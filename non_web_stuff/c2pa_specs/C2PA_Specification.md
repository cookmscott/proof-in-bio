# <span id="page-6-0"></span>**Chapter 1. Introduction**

## <span id="page-6-1"></span>**1.1. Overview**

With the increasing velocity of digital content and the increasing availability of powerful creation and editing techniques, establishing the provenance of media is critical to ensure transparency, understanding, and ultimately, trust.

We are witnessing extraordinary challenges to trust in media. As social platforms amplify the reach and influence of certain content via ever more complex and opaque algorithms, mis-attributed and mis-contextualized content spreads quickly. Whether inadvertent misinformation or deliberate deception via disinformation, inauthentic content is on the rise.

Currently, those who wish to include metadata about their work cannot do so in a secure, tamper-evident and standardized way across platforms. Without this information coming from a recognized source, publishers and consumers lack critical context for determining the authenticity of media.

Provenance empowers content creators and editors, regardless of their geographic location or degree of access to technology, to disclose information about how an asset was created, how it was changed and what was changed. Each time an asset is changed, the existing provenance of the asset is preserved, with each new change being added to the provenance. In this way, content with provenance provides indicators of authenticity so that consumers can have awareness of altered content. Such provenance could include what has been changed and the source of those changes. This ability to provide provenance for creators, publishers and consumers is essential to facilitating trust online.

To address this issue at scale for publishers, creators and consumers, the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) has developed this technical specification for providing content provenance and authenticity. It is designed to enable global, opt-in, adoption of digital provenance techniques through the creation of a rich ecosystem of digital provenance enabled applications for a wide range of individuals and organizations while meeting appropriate security requirements.

This specification has been, and continues to be, informed by scenarios, workflows and requirements gathered from industry experts and partner organizations, including the [Project Origin Alliance](https://www.originproject.info/) and the [Content Authenticity](https://contentauthenticity.org/) [Initiative \(CAI\)](https://contentauthenticity.org/). It is also possible that regulatory bodies and governmental agencies could utilize this specification to establish standards for digital provenance.

## <span id="page-6-2"></span>**1.2. Scope**

This specification describes the technical aspects of the C2PA architecture; a model for storing and accessing cryptographically verifiable information whose trustworthiness can be assessed based on a defined [trust model](#page-72-0). Included in this document is information about how to create and process a C2PA Manifest and its components, including the use of digital signature technology for enabling tamper-evidence as well as establishing trust.

Prior to developing this specification, the C2PA created our [Guiding Principles](https://c2pa.org/principles/) that enabled us to remain focused on ensuring that the specification can be used in ways that respect privacy and personal control of data with a critical eye toward potential abuse and misuse. For example, implementers of this specification are strongly encouraged to provide creators and publishers of media assets with the ability to control whether certain provenance data is included.

From the overarching goals section of the guiding principles:

## **IMPORTANT**

C2PA specifications SHOULD NOT provide value judgments about whether a given set of provenance data is 'good' or 'bad,' merely whether the assertions included within can be validated as associated with the underlying asset, correctly formed, and free from tampering.

It is important that the specification does not negatively impact content accessibility for consumers.

Other documents from the C2PA will address specific implementation considerations such as expected user experiences and details of our threat and harms modelling.

## <span id="page-7-0"></span>**1.3. Technical Overview**

The C2PA information comprises a series of statements that cover areas such as asset creation, edit actions, capture device details, bindings to content and many other subjects. These statements, called assertions, make up the provenance of a given asset and represent a series of trust signals that can be used by a human to improve their view of trustworthiness concerning the asset. Assertions are wrapped up with additional information into a digitally signed entity called a claim. This claim is digitally signed by the claim generator on behalf of the [signer,](#page-10-3) using the signer's signing credential, producing the claim signature.

These assertions, claims, and the claim signature are all bound together into a verifiable unit called a C2PA Manifest (see [Figure 1, "A C2PA Manifest and its constituent parts"\)](#page-8-0) by a hardware or software component called a claim generator. The set of C2PA Manifests, as stored in the asset's Content Credential, represent its provenance data.

Figure 1. A C2PA Manifest and its constituent parts

## **1.3.1. Establishing Trust**

The basis of making trust decisions in C2PA, our [trust model](#page-72-0), is the identity of the signer associated with the cryptographic signing key used to sign a claim in a C2PA Manifest. The claim signatures of C2PA Manifests, when combined with trusted time-stamps, can undergo the validation process indefinitely to determine if claims were signed while the signing credentials were valid and not revoked.

### **1.3.2. An Example**

<span id="page-8-1"></span>A very common scenario will be a user taking a photograph with their C2PA-enabled camera (or phone). In that instance, the camera would create a manifest containing some assertions including information about the camera itself, a thumbnail of the image and some cryptographic hashes that bind the photograph to the manifest. These assertions would then be listed in the Claim, which would be digitally signed and then the entire C2PA Manifest (see [Figure 2, "Example C2PA Manifest of a Photograph"](#page-8-1)) would be embedded into the output JPEG. This C2PA Manifest would remain valid indefinitely.

Figure 2. Example C2PA Manifest of a Photograph

A Manifest Consumer, such as a C2PA validator, helps users to establish the trustworthiness of the asset by first validating the digital signature and its associated credential. It also checks each of the assertions for validity and presents the information contained in them, and the signature, to the user in a way that they can then make an informed decision about the trustworthiness of the digital content.

## **1.3.3. Design Goals**

In the creation of the C2PA architecture, it was important to establish some clear goals for the work to ensure that the technology was usable across a wide spectrum of hardware and software implementations worldwide and accessible to all. Those goals can be found in [Table 1, "C2PA Design Goals".](#page-9-0)

## **2.1.2. Claim generator**

The non-human (hardware or software) [actor](#page-10-4) that generates the [claim](#page-12-1) about an [asset](#page-11-0) as well as the [claim signature](#page-12-2), thus leading to the [asset](#page-11-0)'s associated [C2PA Manifest.](#page-12-3)

## <span id="page-10-3"></span>**2.1.3. Signer**

The credential holder of a private key that is used to sign the [claim](#page-12-1). The [signer](#page-10-3) is identified by the subject of the credential.

## <span id="page-10-7"></span>**2.1.6. Action**

An operation performed by an [actor](#page-10-4) on an [asset.](#page-11-0) For example, "create", "embed", or "apply filter".

# <span id="page-10-2"></span>**2.2. Assets and Content**

## <span id="page-10-6"></span>**2.2.1. Digital content**

The portion of an [asset](#page-11-0) that represents the actual content, such as the pixels of an image, along with any additional technical metadata required to understand the content (e.g., a colour profile or encoding parameters).

## <span id="page-11-1"></span>**2.2.2. Asset metadata**

Non-technical information about the [asset](#page-11-0) and its [digital content](#page-10-6).

## <span id="page-11-0"></span>**2.2.3. Asset**

A file or stream of data containing [digital content](#page-10-6), [asset metadata](#page-11-1) and optionally, a [C2PA Manifest.](#page-12-3)

**NOTE**

For the purposes of this definition, we will extend the typical definition of "file" to include cloudnative and dynamically generated data.

## <span id="page-11-2"></span>**2.2.4. Derived asset**

A [derived asset](#page-11-2) is an [asset](#page-11-0) that is created by starting from an existing [asset](#page-11-0) and performing [actions](#page-10-7) to it that modify its [digital content](#page-10-6).

**EXAMPLE:** An audio stream that has been shortened or a document where pages have been added.

### **2.2.5. Asset rendition**

A representation of an [asset](#page-11-0) (either as a part of an [asset](#page-11-0) or a completely new [asset](#page-11-0)) where the [digital content](#page-10-6) has had a ['non-editorial transformation'](#page-11-3) [action](#page-10-7) (e.g., re-encoding or scaling) applied.

**EXAMPLE:** A video file that is re-encoded for reduced screen resolution or network bandwidth.

## <span id="page-11-4"></span>**2.2.6. Composed asset**

A composed asset is an [asset](#page-11-0) that is created by building up a collection of multiple parts or fragments of [digital](#page-10-6) [content](#page-10-6) (referred to as [ingredients](#page-209-0)) from one or more other [assets.](#page-11-0) When starting from an existing [asset,](#page-11-0) it is a special case of a [derived asset](#page-11-2) - however a [composed asset](#page-11-2) can also be one that starts from a "blank slate".

#### **EXAMPLES:**

- A video created by importing existing video clips and audio segments into a "blank slate".
- An image where another image is imported and super-imposed on top of the starting image.

### <span id="page-11-3"></span>**2.2.7. Editorial transformation**

A type of transformation that alters either the intent or meaning or both of the [digital content](#page-10-6).

## <span id="page-12-0"></span>**2.3. Core Aspects of C2PA**

## <span id="page-12-4"></span>**2.3.1. Assertion**

A data structure which represents a statement either made (or "created") by the [signer](#page-10-3) or simply gathered at claim generation-time, concerning the [asset.](#page-11-0) This data is a part of the [C2PA Manifest.](#page-12-3)

## <span id="page-12-1"></span>**2.3.2. Claim**

A digitally signed and tamper-evident data structure that references a set of [assertions](#page-12-4), concerning an [asset,](#page-11-0) and the information necessary to represent the [content binding.](#page-13-1) If any [assertions](#page-12-4) were redacted, then a declaration to that effect is included. This data is a part of the [C2PA Manifest.](#page-12-3)

## <span id="page-12-2"></span>**2.3.3. Claim signature**

The digital signature on the [claim](#page-12-1) created using the private key owned by a [signer.](#page-10-3) The [claim signature](#page-12-2) is a part of the [C2PA Manifest.](#page-12-3)

## <span id="page-12-3"></span>**2.3.4. C2PA Manifest**

The set of information about the provenance of an [asset](#page-11-0) based on the combination of one or more [assertions](#page-12-4) (including [content bindings\)](#page-41-0), a single [claim](#page-12-1), and a [claim signature.](#page-12-2) A [C2PA Manifest](#page-12-3) is part of a [C2PA Manifest Store.](#page-12-5)

**NOTE** A [C2PA Manifest](#page-12-3) can reference other [C2PA Manifests.](#page-12-3)

## <span id="page-12-5"></span>**2.3.5. C2PA Manifest Store**

A collection of [C2PA Manifests](#page-12-3) that can either be embedded into an [asset](#page-11-0) or be external to its [asset.](#page-11-0)

## **2.3.6. Content Credential**

This is the preferred non-technical term for a [C2PA Manifest](#page-12-3). The [C2PA Manifest Store](#page-12-5) therefore represents the Content Credentials of an asset.

Content Credentials also refers to the overall C2PA technology, and is therefore essentially treated as a plural noun. If a [C2PA Manifest](#page-12-3) is a Content Credential, then multiple [C2PA Manifest](#page-12-3) or the broader, universal concept is Content Credentials.

### <span id="page-12-6"></span>**2.3.7. Active Manifest**

The last manifest in the list of [C2PA Manifests](#page-12-3) inside of a [C2PA Manifest Store](#page-12-5) which is the one with the set of [content](#page-13-1) [bindings](#page-13-1) that are able to be validated.

## **2.3.8. Provenance**

The logical concept of understanding the history of an [asset](#page-11-0) and its interaction with [actors](#page-10-4) and other [assets,](#page-11-0) as represented by the [provenance data](#page-13-0).

### <span id="page-13-0"></span>**2.3.9. Provenance data**

The set of [C2PA Manifests](#page-12-3) for an [asset](#page-11-0) and, in the case of a [composed asset](#page-11-4), its [ingredients](#page-209-0).

**NOTE** A [C2PA Manifest](#page-12-3) can reference other [C2PA Manifests.](#page-12-3)

## **2.3.10. Authenticity**

A property of [digital content](#page-10-6) comprising a set of facts (such as the [provenance data](#page-13-0) and [hard bindings\)](#page-41-2) that can be cryptographically verified as not having been tampered with.

## <span id="page-13-1"></span>**2.3.11. Content binding**

Information that associates [digital content](#page-10-6) to a specific [C2PA Manifest](#page-12-3) associated with a specific [asset](#page-11-0), either as a [hard binding](#page-13-2) or a [soft binding.](#page-180-0)

## <span id="page-13-2"></span>**2.3.12. Hard binding**

One or more cryptographic hashes that uniquely identifies either the entire [asset](#page-11-0) or a portion thereof.

## **2.3.13. Soft binding**

A content identifier that is either (a) not statistically unique, such as a [fingerprint,](#page-14-2) or (b) embedded as an [invisible](#page-14-3) [watermark](#page-14-3) in the identified [digital content.](#page-10-6)

## **2.3.14. Trust signals**

The collection of information that can inform a [Manifest Consumer's](#page-10-5) judgment of the trustworthiness of an [asset](#page-11-0). These are in addition to the [signer](#page-10-3) upon which the fundamental trust model relies.

### **2.3.15. C2PA Trust List**

A C2PA-managed list of X.509 certificate trust anchors that issue certificates to hardware & software [signers](#page-10-3) that use them to sign [claims](#page-12-1).

## **2.3.16. C2PA TSA Trust List**

A C2PA-managed list of X.509 certificate trust anchors that issue certificates to Time Stamping Authorities (TSAs).

## <span id="page-14-0"></span>**2.4. Additional Terms**

## **2.4.1. Durable Content Credential**

A Durable Content Credential is a Content Credential for which there exists one or more soft bindings that enable its discovery in a manifest repository.

## <span id="page-14-2"></span>**2.4.2. Fingerprint**

A set of inherent properties computable from [digital content](#page-10-6) that identifies the content or near duplicates of it.

**EXAMPLE:** An [asset](#page-11-0) can become separated from its [C2PA Manifest](#page-12-3) due to removal or corruption of [asset](#page-11-0) metadata. A [fingerprint](#page-14-2) of the [digital content](#page-10-6) of the [asset](#page-11-0) could be used to search a database to recover the [asset](#page-11-0) with an intact [C2PA Manifest.](#page-12-3)

## <span id="page-14-3"></span>**2.4.3. Invisible Watermark**

Information incorporated in a substantially human imperceptible way into the [digital content](#page-10-6) of an [asset](#page-11-0) which can be used, for example, to uniquely identify the [asset](#page-11-0) or to store a reference to a [C2PA Manifest.](#page-12-3)

### **2.4.4. Visible Watermark**

A perceptible component of the [digital content](#page-10-6) carrying some human consumable information about the provenance of the [asset.](#page-11-0)

## **2.4.5. Manifest Repository**

A repository into which [C2PA Manifests](#page-12-3) and [C2PA Manifest Stores](#page-12-5) can be placed, and which can be searched using a [content binding](#page-13-1).

# <span id="page-19-0"></span>**Chapter 4. Standard Terms**

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14,](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14) [RFC 2119,](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) and [RFC 8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174) when they appear in any casing (upper, lower or mixed).

CDDL Rules and Type Definitions in the CDDL schemas for C2PA constructs are normative. [Schema validation](#page-31-0) is not necessary, nor it is recommended. Comments within CDDL schemas are non-normative.

# <span id="page-20-0"></span>**Chapter 5. Versioning**

## <span id="page-20-1"></span>**5.1. Compatibility**

As the Content Credentials specification has evolved, constructs such as box labels, assertions (and their fields), claims and time-stamps have also evolved. New assertions have been added, and some existing assertions and the claim have newer versions with additional fields. In addition, some constructs have been deprecated. In this specification, when a construct is marked as deprecated, that means that a claim generator shall not write that construct (or value), but that a validator should read it.

To facilitate interoperability between claim generators and validators, a claim generator may declare which version of the specification it is using to generate the C2PA Manifest by providing a [specVersion](#page-46-0) [key](#page-46-0) in the claim. When a claim generator declares that it is using a version of the specification, it is declaring that the active manifest of the asset is produced in accordance with that version of the specification and thus, for example, does not contain any constructs that are deprecated in that version of the specification (see [Table 19, "Status of constructs"](#page-282-2) of [Appendix C,](#page-282-0) [Considerations for Deprecation](#page-282-0)).

A validator shall be compatible with at least one version of the specification, but may be compatible with additional versions. A validator that is compatible with a specific version of the specification shall support all non-deprecated constructs listed for that version. If the validator encounters a C2PA Manifest that uses constructs from a version of the specification that the validator does not support (either because they are deprecated or unknown), it may ignore the unsupported construct and process the rest of C2PA Manifest as if that construct were not present.

When a claim generator is performing ingredient validation, it may add a [specVersion](#page-220-0) [key](#page-220-0) to the validationresults-map to declare what version of the specification was used as the basis for the validation procedure.

## <span id="page-20-2"></span>**5.2. Forward Compatibility**

C2PA aims to ensure that Content Credentials created under newer versions of the specification remains parseable and validatable when processed by implementations conforming to earlier versions, wherever practical. Implementations of the C2PA specification should therefore be designed to:

- Gracefully handle unknown or unrecognized data (e.g., new fields, structures, or claim types) without causing fatal errors.
- Preserve the integrity of a C2PA Manifest even when parts of it cannot be fully interpreted.
- Indicate partial interpretation to users or downstream systems, rather than rejecting the C2PA Manifest outright.

While this specification strives to maintain both forward and backward compatibility, there may be occasions when breaking changes are necessary to enable significant advances or address fundamental security, trust, or interoperability concerns. In such cases, versioning guidance and migration considerations will be explicitly documented.

## **5.3.4. 2.0 - January 2024**

This version represents a significant departure from previous versions. It reduces the use of the term "actor", which no longer represents humans and organisations. In addition to validator-configured trust lists, it also introduces a new default trust list, the "C2PA Trust List", which is intended to cover certificates issued to hardware and software. This philosophical change led to the following functional changes in the specification:

- Only X.509 certificates may be used for signing.
- Improvements to the Validation & Trust Model sections
  - Introduces the concepts of "well-formed" and "valid" C2PA Manifests
  - Clarifies various aspects of the validation process
- Refined metadata handling
  - removed the deprecated Exif, IPTC and Schema.org metadata assertions
  - defined a new general "metadata assertion" concept
  - c2pa.metadata only allows a fixed set of schemas & values
  - the process for creating c2pa.metadata is now documented in more detail
  - XMP processing sections have been revamped to reflect relevant changes
  - improved recommendations concerning hashing of standard metadata locations outside the manifest
- Removed the "W3C Verifiable Credentials" section
  - Removed any references to it and the VC Store.
  - Removed the actors field from the actions assertion
  - Removed identified humans from assertion metadata
- Removed the "Training & Data Mining" assertion
- Removed the "Endorsements" assertion

In addition, the following other changes were made to improve various aspects of the spec:

- Version v2 version of the claim.
  - Removes deprecated and unused fields
  - Split assertions into created\_assertions & gathered\_assertions
  - Only allows a single claim generator, which must be the signer
  - claim-generator-info now has a specific operating\_system field

### **5.3.9. 1.0 - December 2021**

• Initial Release

# <span id="page-29-0"></span>**Chapter 6. Assertions**

## <span id="page-29-1"></span>**6.1. General**

It is expected that each claim generator, used by actors in the system that creates or processes an asset, will create or assemble one or more assertions about when, where, and how the asset was originated or transformed. An assertion is labelled data, typically (though not required to be) in a CBOR-based structure which represents a declaration about an asset. Some of these assertions will contain human-generated information (e.g., alternate text for accessibility) while others will come from machines (software/hardware) providing the information they generated (e.g., camera type).

Some examples of assertions are:

- metadata (e.g., camera information such as maker or lens);
- actions performed on the asset (e.g., clipping, color correction);
- thumbnail of the asset or its ingredients;
- content bindings (e.g., cryptographic hashes).

Certain assertions may be redacted by subsequent claims (see [Section 6.8, "Redaction of Assertions"](#page-31-3)), but they cannot be modified once made as part of a claim.

## <span id="page-29-2"></span>**6.2. Labels**

## <span id="page-29-4"></span>**6.2.1. Namespacing**

String values in C2PA data structures may be organized into namespaces using a period (.) as a separator. The C2PA namespace, c2pa, shall be the beginning of any string value defined in this specification. Entity-specific namespaces shall begin with the Internet domain name for the entity similar to how Java packages are defined (e.g., com.litware, net.fineartschool).

The period-separated components of an entity-specific namespace shall follow the variable naming convention ([azA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\_-]\*) specified in the POSIX or C locale, as defined in the ABNF below ([ABNF for](#page-29-3) [Namespaces](#page-29-3)).

<span id="page-29-3"></span>ABNF for Namespaces

```
qualified-namespace = "c2pa" / entity
entity = entity-component *( "." entity-component )
entity-component = 1( DIGIT / ALPHA ) *( DIGIT / ALPHA / "-" / "_" )
```

## <span id="page-30-2"></span>**6.2.2. Label Naming**

Each assertion has a label defined either by the C2PA specifications or an external entity. These labels are strings which are namespaced, as described in the preceding clause or by an entity. The most common labels will be defined in the c2pa namespace, but labels may use any namespace that follows the conventions. Labels are also versioned with a simple incrementing integer scheme (e.g., c2pa.actions.v2). If no version is provided, it is considered as v1. The list of publicly known labels can be found in [Chapter 18,](#page-133-0) [C2PA Standard Assertions](#page-133-0).

**NOTE**

Previous versions of this document also provided for namespacing for well-established standards, but that has been superseded by simply having them via entity-specific namespaces (e.g., org.iso, org.w3).

ABNF for Assertion Labels

```
namespaced-label = qualified-namespace label
qualified-namespace = "c2pa" / entity
entity = entity-component *( "." entity-component )
entity-component = 1( DIGIT / ALPHA ) *( DIGIT / ALPHA / "-" / "_" )
label = 1*( "." label-component )
label-component = 1( DIGIT / ALPHA ) *( DIGIT / ALPHA / "-" / "_" )
```

The period-separated components of a label follow the variable naming convention ([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\_-]\*) specified in the POSIX or C locale, with the restriction that the use of a repeated underscore character (\_\_) is reserved for labelling multiple assertions of the same type.

## <span id="page-30-0"></span>**6.3. Versioning**

When an assertion's schema is changed, it should be done in a backwards-compatible manner. This means that new fields may be added and existing ones may be marked as deprecated (i.e., can be read, but never written). Existing fields shall not be removed. The label would then consist of an incremented version number, for example moving from c2pa.actions (deprecated) to c2pa.actions.v2.

Since the addition of optional fields can be done while maintaining backwards compatibility, such fields may be added to an existing assertion's schema without a change to the version number.

Deprecated fields for C2PA standard assertions shall be indicated in [Chapter 18,](#page-133-0) [C2PA Standard Assertions](#page-133-0). Claim generators shall not insert data into deprecated assertion fields when creating assertions.

In those situations where a non-backwards compatible change is required, instead of increasing the label's version number, the assertion shall be given a new label.

**NOTE** For example, c2pa.ingredient could be changed to the fictional c2pa.component.

## <span id="page-30-1"></span>**6.4. Multiple Instances**

Multiple assertions of the same type can occur in the same manifest, but since assertions are referenced by claims via

their label, the assertion labels are required to be unique. This is accomplished by adding a double-underscore and a monotonically increasing index to the label. For example, if a manifest contains a single assertion of type c2pa.metadata, then the assertion label will be c2pa.metadata. If a manifest contains three assertions of this type, the labels will be c2pa.metadata, c2pa.metadata\_\_1 and c2pa.metadata\_\_2.

When a label includes a version number, that version number is part of the label itself. As such, when there are multiple instances, the instance number continues to follow the label - e.g., c2pa.ingredient.v2\_\_2.

## <span id="page-31-0"></span>**6.5. Schema Validation**

The schemas provided in this document, as well as the machine readable ones that are downloaded-able from the C2PA website, should be used by claim generators to ensure that the assertions they create are consistent with the expected structures. These schemas can also be used as aids in understanding the syntax to be read or written. Validators should not validate inputs against these schemas.

## <span id="page-31-1"></span>**6.6. Assertion Store**

The set of assertions referenced by a [claim](#page-44-0) in a manifest are collected together into a logical construct that is referred to as the assertion store. The assertions and assertion store shall be stored as described in [Section 11.1, "Use of](#page-56-1) [JUMBF";](#page-56-1) in particular, each assertion referenced in a claim's created\_assertions or gathered\_assertions (but not [redacted\\_assertions](#page-31-3)) shall be present in the assertion store located in the same C2PA Manifest as the claim.

In each manifest, there is a single assertion store. However, as an asset may have multiple manifests associated with it, each one representing a specific series of assertions, there may be multiple assertion stores associated with an asset.

## <span id="page-31-2"></span>**6.7. Embedded vs Externally-Stored Data**

Some assertion data, due to its size or an infrequent need for it, may be externally hosted. Such data are not embedded in the assertion store, but instead are referenced by URI. This is accomplished through a cloud data or external reference assertion (see [Section 18.11, "Cloud Data"\)](#page-188-0). Unlike embedded assertion data, this external assertion data is not retrieved nor validated as part of manifest validation, and is only retrieved and validated when specifically needed by an application according to a different set of validation rules as described in [Section 15.10,](#page-104-0) ["Validate the Assertions"](#page-104-0).

# <span id="page-31-3"></span>**6.8. Redaction of Assertions**

Assertions that are present in an asset-embedded manifest may be removed from that asset's manifest when the asset is [used as an ingredient.](#page-60-0) This process is called redaction.

Redaction involves either removing the entire assertion from the manifest's assertion store or retaining the labelled

assertion container but replacing the JUMBF Content boxes within that assertion with a single UUID Content box whose ID field has a value of CAA98EEE-9D4D-F80E-86AD-4DFFCA263973 (called the C2PA Redaction UUID) and whose DATA field contains only zeros (binary 0x00 values).

In addition, a record that something was removed shall be added to the [claim](#page-44-0) in the form of a [URI reference](#page-37-0) to the redacted assertion in the redacted\_assertions field of the claim. It is also strongly recommended that the claim generator should add a c2pa.redacted [action](#page-193-0) with a redacted field as described in [Section 18.15.4.7,](#page-199-0) ["Parameters"](#page-199-0).

When redacting an ingredient assertion that references a C2PA Manifest, the associated manifest shall be removed from the C2PA Manifest Store if no other references to it remain after redacting.

**NOTE**

Because each assertion's [URI reference](#page-37-0) includes the assertion label, it is also known what type of information (e.g., thumbnail, metadata, etc.) was removed. This enables both humans and machines to apply rules to determine if the removal was acceptable.

Unless the redaction of the assertion also requires modification to the digital content, an [update manifest](#page-63-0) shall be used to document the redaction as it makes a statement about the non-changes to the content.

Claim generators shall not redact assertions with a label of c2pa.actions or c2pa.actions.v2 as this assertion type represents essential information in understanding the history of an asset. They shall also not redact any [hard](#page-41-0) [binding to content](#page-41-0) assertion - either a c2pa.hash.data, c2pa.hash.boxes, c2pa.hash.collection.data, c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 (deprecated), or c2pa.hash.bmff.v3, as these assertions are necessary for determining the integrity of the asset.

**NOTE**

When assertions are redacted in an ingredient manifest that is referenced via either of the deprecated ingredient assertions (c2pa.ingredient or c2pa.ingredient.v2), validation of that assertion will fail (as described in [Section 15.11.3, "Ingredient Assertion Validation"](#page-113-0)), because only c2pa.ingredient.v3 assertions support the claim signature hash validation method, described in [Section 15.11.3.3.1, "Claim Signature Hash Validation Method".](#page-117-0)

## <span id="page-32-0"></span>**6.9. Specifications of time in assertions**

The default specification for a date/time value in an assertion is the date/time format which is serialized in CBOR as tag number 0 ([RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), 3.4.1) and represented in CDDL as type tdate.

**NOTE**

CBOR Tag 0 is described in [RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949) as "the date-time production in [RFC 3339,](http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) as refined by Section 3.3 of [RFC 4287](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4287), representing the point in time described there". This means that the presence of either an explicit timezone or Z (for UTC) is required.

There is one case, as described when [adding a claimed time of signing](#page-70-0), where the time is represented as a CBOR tag number 1 ([RFC 8949,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949) 3.4.2) (as the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00Z).

Additionally there is the [time-stamp assertion,](#page-224-0) which uses the standard time-stamping formats as described in [the](#page-48-0) [signing process.](#page-48-0)

| The reason why there are different types of date & time representations is to allow for the most appropriate<br>representation, based on existing standards in use, for each specific use case. |  |  |  |

# <span id="page-34-0"></span>**Chapter 7. Data Boxes**

## **IMPORTANT**

This section is retained for historical purposes. The concept of a data box has been deprecated in favour of a standard assertion that uses a standard JUMBF Embedded File content type box to contain the data. For more information, see [Chapter 7,](#page-34-0) [Data Boxes](#page-34-0).

## <span id="page-34-1"></span>**7.1. General**

Data boxes provide a way to include arbitrary data into the C2PA Manifest that is referenced from an assertion, instead of embedding it directly into a field of the assertion as a binary string. These data boxes are placed in the [Data](#page-61-0) [Box Store](#page-61-0) and each one will be a single CBOR Content Type box (cbor).

The data of a data box is provided directly as the value of the data field, which is a bstr, so any binary data can be provided. The type of the data shall be identified using the dc:format field, with a standard IANA media type.

**NOTE**

IANA structured suffixes ([https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-type-structured-suffix/media](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-type-structured-suffix/media-type-structured-suffix.xhtml)[type-structured-suffix.xhtml](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-type-structured-suffix/media-type-structured-suffix.xhtml)), such as +json and +zip, are also supported as values of the dc:format field.

Sometimes, it may also be necessary to provide one or more [asset types](#page-227-0) as the value of the data\_types field for more clarity on the format and usage of that data.

A data box shall have a label of c2pa.data and follows the [rules of assertion labels](#page-30-1) with respect to multiple instances.

## <span id="page-34-2"></span>**7.2. Schema and Example**

The schema for this type is defined by the data-box-map rule in the [CDDL Definition](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610) in [CDDL for data box](#page-34-3).:

<span id="page-34-3"></span>CDDL for data box

```
; box allowing for the storage of arbitrary data
data-box-map = {
  "dc:format": format-string, ; IANA media type of the data
  "data" : bstr, ; arbitrary text/binary data
  ? "data_types": [1* $asset-type-map], ; additional information about the data's type
}
```

# <span id="page-35-0"></span>**Chapter 8. Unique Identifiers**

## <span id="page-35-1"></span>**8.1. Uniquely Identifying C2PA Manifests and Assets**

Every C2PA Manifest is uniquely identified and referenced by a Uniform Resource Name [RFC 8141, URNs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141) from the c2pa URN namespace, and a C2PA asset is uniquely identified by the c2pa URN value of its active manifest. The ABNF for the C2PA URN is described by [ABNF for C2PA URN](#page-35-2).

A c2pa URN shall consist of two mandatory and two optional components, in the following order, with colons (:) between each section.

- URN identifier (urn:c2pa): REQUIRED.
- UUID v4, in string representation (as per RFC 9562, section 4): REQUIRED.
- Claim Generator identifier string : OPTIONAL.
- Version and Reason string (as described below) : OPTIONAL.

When present, the "Claim Generator identifier" string shall consist of no more than 32 characters from the ASCII range (as per RFC 20), but which are not Control Characters (RFC 20, 5.2) or Graphic Characters (RFC 20, 5.3).

When present, the "Version and Reason" string shall consist of a positive integer, followed by an underscore (\_) and then another positive integer. The details of each of these values and how they are to be used is described in [Versioning Manifests Due to Conflicts.](#page-36-0) In addition, when a "Version and Reason" string is present, a "Claim Generator identifier" string shall also be present but it may be empty.

#### <span id="page-35-2"></span>ABNF for C2PA URN

```
c2pa_urn = c2pa-namespace UUID [claim-generator [version-reason]]
c2pa-namespace = "urn:c2pa:"
; this definition is taken from RFC 9562
UUID = 4hexOctet "-"
  2hexOctet "-"
  2hexOctet "-"
  2hexOctet "-"
  6hexOctet
hexOctet = HEXDIG HEXDIG
DIGIT = %x30-39
HEXDIG = DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"
; ASCII, but not Control Characters or Graphic Characters
visible-char-except-space = %x21-7E / %x80-FF
; claim-generator-identifier is a string of 0 to 32 visible-char-except-space characters
; this means that an empty string is valid
claim-generator = ":" claim-generator-identifier
claim-generator-identifier = 0*32visible-char-except-space
; version-reason is a string consisting of a positive integer 
; followed by an underscore and a positive integer
```

```
version-reason = ":" version "_" reason
version = 1*DIGIT
reason = 1*DIGIT
```

#### Examples:

```
• urn:c2pa:F9168C5E-CEB2-4FAA-B6BF-329BF39FA1E4
• urn:c2pa:F9168C5E-CEB2-4FAA-B6BF-329BF39FA1E4:acme
• urn:c2pa:F9168C5E-CEB2-4FAA-B6BF-329BF39FA1E4:acme:2_1
• urn:c2pa:F9168C5E-CEB2-4FAA-B6BF-329BF39FA1E4::2_1
```

**NOTE**

Previous versions of this specification used [RFC 9562, UUIDs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9562) URN, and had the identifier of the claim generator at the beginning of the URN. However, this was found to be not in compliance with either [RFC 9562, UUIDs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9562) or [RFC 8141, URNs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141).

This c2pa URN identifier is used in various parts of a C2PA-enabled workflow, such as when identifying an asset as an [ingredient](#page-209-0) in a derived or composed asset.

## <span id="page-36-0"></span>**8.2. Versioning Manifests Due to Conflicts**

Situations may arise where it is necessary to re-label a C2PA Manifest due to a conflict of identifiers. For example, if a claim generator had already added an ingredient manifest into the asset's C2PA Manifest Store, then later added another ingredient which had a manifest with the same label in its manifest store, but this latter version of the manifest was different due, for example, to a manipulation of one of its assertion values. In such a case, the modified version of the ingredient manifest needs to be copied into the asset's C2PA Manifest Store, and shall be re-labeled.

To re-label a manifest:

- If the current URN does not contain a "Claim Generator identifier string", then the claim generator shall append a :.
- In all cases, the claim generator shall append a : to the URN followed by a monotonically increasing integer, starting with 1, followed by an underscore (\_) and then an integer from the list below representing the reason for the re-labeling.
  - 1: Conflict with another C2PA Manifest

For example, if the claim generator has to re-label a C2PA Manifest for the second time due to a conflict, the appended string would be :2\_1.

## <span id="page-36-1"></span>**8.3. Identifying Non-C2PA Assets**

When working with assets that do not contain a C2PA Manifest, but the asset contains embedded XMP which include values for xmpMM:DocumentID and/or xmpMM:InstanceID as defined in [XMP Specification Part 2, 2.2,](https://github.com/adobe/xmp-docs/blob/master/XMPNamespaces/XMPDataTypes/ResourceEvent.md) those values shall be used as identifiers for the asset.

When working with assets that do not contain a C2PA Manifest and do not contain embedded XMP, the claim generator may use any method of its choosing to provide it with a unique identifier.

## <span id="page-37-0"></span>**8.4. URI References**

### **8.4.1. Standard URIs**

All references to information in the manifest, whether stored internally to the asset (i.e., embedded) or stored externally to the asset (e.g., in the cloud), shall be referenced via JUMBF URI references as defined in ISO 19566- 5:2023, C.2. These URIs are normally used either as part of a hashed\_uri or hashed\_ext\_uri data structure.

When the reference is to a [compressed manifest](#page-64-2), the JUMBF URI shall not contain anything about the brob box, but the URI to the manifest is treated as if the manifest was not compressed. This means that the URI would include the label of the c2ma or c2um box, but not the label of the c2cm box. In addition, the URI reference to a compressed manifest shall not include the label of the brob box - but only the label of the compressed manifest itself.

When resolving an internal JUMBF URI reference, if any label in the path is ambiguous due to multiple child boxes having the same label, a validator shall treat the reference as unresolved.

## <span id="page-37-2"></span>**8.4.2. Hashed URIs**

#### **8.4.2.1. Embedded**

A hashed\_uri is used when the URI is for something embedded in the same C2PA Manifest Store.

This specification provides an equivalent hashed-uri-map data structure (in [CDDL for hashed URI\)](#page-37-1) for schemas using a [CDDL Definition:](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610)

<span id="page-37-1"></span>CDDL for hashed URI

```
; The data structure used to store a reference to a URL within the same JUMBF and its hash.
We use a socket/plug here to allow hashed-uri-map to be used in individual files without
having the map defined in the same file
$hashed-uri-map /= {
  "url": jumbf-uri-type, ; JUMBF URI reference
  ? "alg": tstr .size (1..max-tstr-length), ; A string identifying the cryptographic hash
algorithm used to compute all hashes in this claim, taken from the C2PA hash algorithm
identifier list. If this field is absent, the hash algorithm is taken from an enclosing
structure as defined by that structure. If both are present, the field in this structure is
used. If no value is present in any of these places, this structure is invalid; there is no
default.
  "hash": bstr, ; byte string containing the hash value
}
; with CBOR Head (#) and tail ($) are introduced in regexp, so not needed explicitly
jumbf-uri-type /= tstr .regexp "self#jumbf=[\\w\\d\/][\\w\\d\\.\/:-]+[\\w\\d]"
```

Because assertion stores shall be located in the same C2PA Manifest box as the claim that refers to them, only self#jumbf URIs are permitted. These self#jumbf URIs may be relative to the entire C2PA Manifest Store, in which case they shall start with a / (U+002F, Slash), or relative to the current C2PA Manifest. URIs shall not contain the sequence .. (a pair of U+002E, Full Stop).

#### Example 1. Example self#jumbf URIs

The following are examples of valid self#jumbf URIs:

- self#jumbf=/c2pa/urn:c2pa:F095F30E-6CD5-4BF7-8C44- CE8420CA9FB7/c2pa.assertions/c2pa.thumbnail.claim is relative to the entire store (since it starts with /);
- self#jumbf=c2pa.assertions/c2pa.thumbnail.claim would be relative to the manifest of the box containing the URI.

### **8.4.2.2. External**

When referring to a resource that exists externally to the C2PA Manifest Store, a hashed-ext-uri-map data structure is used. It is a variation on the hashed-uri, in that it references an external URI instead of a self#jumbf. The hashed-ext-uri data structure is defined by the hashed-ext-uri-map rule in the following CDDL in [CDDL for hashed external URI](#page-38-0):

<span id="page-38-0"></span>CDDL for hashed external URI

```
; The data structure used to store a reference to an external URL and its hash. 
; We use a socket/plug here to allow hashed-ext-uri-map to be used in individual files 
; without having the map defined in the same file
$hashed-ext-uri-map /= {
  "url": ext-url-type, ; http/https URI reference
  "alg": tstr .size (1..max-tstr-length), ; A string identifying the cryptographic hash
algorithm used to compute the hash on this URI's data, taken from the C2PA hash algorithm
identifier list. Unlike alg fields in other types, this field is mandatory here.
  "hash": bstr, ; byte string containing the hash value
  ? "dc:format": format-string, ; IANA media type of the data
  ? "size": size-type, ; Number of bytes of data
  ? "data_types": [1* $asset-type-map], ; additional information about the data's type
}
; with CBOR Head (#) and tail ($) are introduced in regexp, so not needed explicitly
ext-url-type /= tstr .regexp "https?:\/\/[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{2,256}\\.[a-z]{2,6}\\b[-a-
zA-Z0-9@:%_\\+.~#?&//=]*"
```

#### **IMPORTANT**

In keeping with common practice, it is recommended that the https scheme be used to retrieve assertion data to protect the privacy of the data in transit, but http is also permitted because the data's integrity is protected by the hash field and this privacy may not be required in all circumstances. Authors of manifests with external URIs should choose the scheme to suit their needs.

The optional dc:format field, when present, provides an alternative to the Content-Type field of the http(s) headers. If present, this field shall be used as the required format retrieved during any content negotiate/request. Sometimes, it may also be necessary to provide one or more [asset types](#page-227-0) as the value of the data\_types field for more clarity on the format and usage of that data.

An optional size field is also provided to specify the size of the data to be retrieved. This may be useful to a validator as a hint in addition to the hash.

**NOTE** It could be used to provide information about whether to perform downloading or validation or both.

### <span id="page-39-0"></span>**8.4.2.3. Hashing JUMBF Boxes**

When creating a URI reference to any JUMBF box (e.g., [assertions](#page-29-0) and [data boxes](#page-34-0)), the hash shall be performed over the contents of the structure's JUMBF superbox, which includes both the JUMBF Description Box and all content boxes therein (but does not include the structure's JUMBF superbox header).

**NOTE** More details on hashing can be found at [Section 13.1, "Hashing"](#page-67-1).

As described in the latest version of JUMBF (ISO 19566-5:2023), and shown in [Figure 4, "Example](#page-40-0) [c2pa.actions](#page-40-0) [assertion"](#page-40-0), a new Private field can be present as part of any JUMBF Description box. This C2PA specification defines the C2PA salt as a Private field whose value is a standard box consisting of:

- a box length (LBox, as a 4-byte big-endian unsigned integer);
- a box type (TBox, 4-byte big-endian unsigned integer, with a value of c2sh (for C2PA salt hash));
- and payload data (consisting of randomly-generated binary data of either 16 or 32 bytes in length).

# <span id="page-41-0"></span>**Chapter 9. Binding to Content**

## <span id="page-41-1"></span>**9.1. Overview**

A key aspect to the [standard C2PA manifest](#page-62-1) is the presence of one or more data structures, called content bindings, that can uniquely identify portions of the asset. There are two types of bindings that are supported by C2PA - hard bindings and soft bindings. A hard binding (also known as a cryptographic binding) enables the validator to ensure that (a) this manifest belongs with this asset and (b) that the asset has not been modified, by determining values that can match only this asset and no other, not even other assets derived from it or renditions produced from it. A soft binding is computed from the digital content of an asset, rather than its raw bits. A soft binding is useful for identifying derived assets and asset renditions.

A single manifest shall not contain more than one assertion defining a hard binding but may contain zero or more assertions defining soft bindings.

## <span id="page-41-2"></span>**9.2. Hard Bindings**

## **9.2.1. Hashing using byte ranges**

The simplest type of hard binding that can be used to detect tampering is a cryptographic hashing algorithm, as described in [Section 13.1, "Hashing"](#page-67-1), over some or all of the bytes of an asset. This approach can be used on any type of asset, but should only be considered for formats that don't support one of the forms of box-based hashing.

When using this form of hard binding, a [data hash assertion](#page-148-0) is used to define the range of bytes that are hashed (and those that are not). Because a data hash assertion defines a byte range, it is flexible enough to be usable whether the asset is a single binary or represented in multiple chunks or portions.

## **9.2.2. Hashing using a general box hash**

When an asset's format is a non-BMFF-based box format, such as JPEG, PNG, GIF or others listed [here](#page-166-0), then a [general](#page-164-0) [box hash](#page-164-0) assertion should be used. This assertion consists of an array of structures, each one listing one or more boxes (by their name/identifier) and a hash that covers that data of those boxes (and any possible data that may be present in the file between them), along with the algorithm used for [hashing.](#page-67-1)

## <span id="page-41-3"></span>**9.2.3. Hashing a BMFF-formatted asset**

If the asset is based on [ISO BMFF](https://www.iso.org/standard/74428.html) then a hard binding optimized for the box-based format (called [BMFF-based hash](#page-150-0) [assertions](#page-150-0)) may be used instead.

For a monolithic MP4 file asset where the mdat box is validated as a unit, the assertion is validated nearly identically to a data hash assertion. It simply uses a box exclusion list instead of byte ranges to define the range of bytes that are hashed (and those that are not).

For fragmented MP4 (fMP4) files, the assertion itself shall be combined with chunk-specific hashing information which is located as specified in [Section A.5, "Embedding manifests into BMFF-based assets"](#page-259-0).

The details on how to hash individual segments for live video can be found [here](#page-240-0).

## **9.2.4. Hashing unstructured text assets**

For unstructured text assets that have a C2PA Manifest embedded using Unicode Variation Selectors as described in [Section A.7, "Embedding Manifests into Unstructured Text",](#page-268-0) a [data hash assertions](#page-148-0) shall be used. This assertion provides a hard binding mechanism specifically designed for text content where the C2PA Manifest is embedded as a sequence of non-rendering Unicode characters.

Normative references: [Unicode Standard, Ch. 23 \(Variation Selectors\)](https://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/ch23.pdf)

### **9.2.5. Hashing a Collection**

In workflows where the C2PA Manifest will refer to a collection of assets, instead of a single asset, the [collection data](#page-173-0) [hash assertion](#page-173-0) shall be used as the method to specify the hard bindings for the assets in the collection.

**NOTE**

For example, a collection data hash assertion can be used to describe each folder of a training data set for an AI/ML model.

## <span id="page-42-1"></span>**9.2.6. Binding Non-C2PA Asset Metadata**

One of the capabilities of a hard binding is that it can exclude parts of an asset, for various reasons. However, a Claim Generator should, where possible, include asset metadata (i.e., metadata outside a C2PA Manifest such as EXIF or XMP) in the hard binding, in order to protect its integrity throughout the asset's lifecycle.

**NOTE**

Only signed C2PA created\_assertions are attributed to the signer. Any asset metadata outside of this specific mechanism, whether included in hard bindings or not, is not attributed to the signer by this specification. For example, the signer is not responsible for the accuracy of a GPS location appearing in EXIF metadata, even if that metadata is covered by the hard binding. However, if the GPS EXIF metadata are serialized in a c2pa.metadata assertion that is included in created\_assertions, that is an explicit signal from the signer that it is asserting the GPS location associated with the asset.

Any asset metadata values that are supported by the [common metadata assertion](#page-222-0), as described in [Appendix B,](#page-273-0) [Implementation Details for](#page-273-0) *[c2pa.metadata](#page-273-0)*, and can be asserted by the signer, should be copied into such an assertion and included in the C2PA Manifest.

## <span id="page-42-0"></span>**9.3. Soft Bindings**

## **9.3.1. General**

Soft bindings are described using [soft binding assertions](#page-180-0) such as a fingerprint computed from the digital content or an invisible watermark embedded within the digital content. These soft bindings enable digital content to be matched even if the underlying bits differ.

**NOTE** For example, an asset rendition in a different resolution or encoding format.

Additionally, if a C2PA manifest is removed from an asset, but a copy of that manifest remains in a provenance store elsewhere, the manifest and asset may be matched using available soft bindings.

Because they serve a different purpose, a soft binding shall not be used as a hard binding.

## **9.3.2. Referenced List of Soft Binding Algorithms**

Soft bindings are generated by an algorithm named in the `alg' field of the [soft binding assertion](#page-180-0). The algorithm name should be among those algorithms listed in the [soft binding algorithm list](#page-183-0) as supported by this specification.

# <span id="page-44-0"></span>**Chapter 10. Claims**

## <span id="page-44-1"></span>**10.1. Overview**

A **claim** gathers together all the assertions about an asset at a given time including the set of assertions for [binding to](#page-41-0) [the content](#page-41-0). The claim is then cryptographically hashed and signed as described in [Section 10.3.2.4, "Signing a](#page-48-0) [Claim".](#page-48-0) A claim has all the same properties as an assertion including being assigned the label (c2pa.claim.v2) but it does not support the use of [assertion metadata.](#page-142-0) A claim is encoded as CBOR data, and such, shall comply with the Core Deterministic Encoding Requirements of CBOR (see [RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), clause 4.2.1).

**NOTE**

Previous versions supported the use of assertion metadata with claims, but this has been deprecated.

A previous version of this specification used the label c2pa.claim and associated claim-map for the Claim, but those have now been deprecated. Validators should still accept this label (and associated claim-map), but claim generators shall not produce such a claim.

## <span id="page-44-2"></span>**10.2. Syntax**

## **10.2.1. Schema**

The schema for this type is defined by the claim-map-v2 and claim-map rules in the following [CDDL Definition](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610) for claims with labels c2pa.claim.v2 and c2pa.claim, respectively:

## **10.2.2. Fields**

The alg field shall contain the hash algorithm used to compute the hash for any hashed-uri, hard binding assertion, or hash assertion that does not explicitly define it. The value of this field, if present, shall be a string that is one of the allowed hash algorithms as defined in [Section 13.1, "Hashing".](#page-67-1) If the alg field is not present, then each hashed-uri, each hard binding assertion, and each hash assertion shall explicitly declare which hashing algorithm is to be used.

If present, the value of dc:title shall be a human-readable name for the asset.

**NOTE** The c2pa.claim has a dc:format field which is no longer present in c2pa.claim.v2.

If the asset contains XMP, then the asset's xmpMM:InstanceID should be used as the instanceID. When no XMP is available, then some other [unique identifier](#page-35-0) for the asset shall be used as the value for instanceID.

**NOTE** Some field names, such as dc:title, have namespace prefixes as their names and definitions are taken directly from the XMP standard. However, their usage in C2PA does not require the use of XMP.

The signature field shall be present and it shall contain an **absolute** [URI reference](#page-37-0) to the [claim signature](#page-48-0) in the same C2PA Manifest.

The created\_assertions field shall be present and it shall contain one or more [URI references](#page-37-0) to [assertions](#page-29-0) being made by this claim. In a standard manifest, it shall contain, at minimum, a reference to an assertion that represents a [hard binding.](#page-41-2)

**NOTE** All created\_assertions are attributed to the signer as the [Trust Model](#page-72-0) is rooted in the trust of the signer.

When present, the gathered\_assertions field shall contain one or more [URI references](#page-37-0) to assertions that have been provided to the claim generator by other components in the workflow.

**NOTE**

By putting an assertion into this list, the claim generator is declaring that the assertion is part of the claim, but it was not sourced from the claim generator and is not attributed to the signer. For example, assertions containing information entered by a human actor would be listed in gathered\_assertions.

When present, the redacted\_assertions field shall contain one or more [URI references](#page-37-0) to [redacted assertions.](#page-31-3)

<span id="page-46-0"></span>A specVersion field may be present, and if so, shall contain a SemVer formatted specVersion field which represents the version of this specification that was used to create this C2PA Manifest.

**NOTE** This field is purely informational and can be ignored during validation.

## <span id="page-47-1"></span>**10.2.3. Claim Generator Info**

#### **10.2.3.1. General**

Detailed information about the claim generator shall be present as the value of claim\_generator\_info. A Manifest Consumer shall use the value of claim\_generator\_info in determining information about the claim generator for itself or for presentation in a UX.

**NOTE**

The c2pa.claim has a claim\_generator field, whose value is a simple string, which is no longer present in c2pa.claim.v2.

#### <span id="page-47-2"></span>**10.2.3.2. Generator Info Map**

When adding a claim\_generator\_info field, its value is a generator-info-map object which shall contain a name field. It may also contain either a version field or an icon field or both. In addition, any other field is permitted, using the standard entity-specific namespacing described in [Section 6.2.1, "Namespacing".](#page-29-4) The data in this object shall represent the non-human (hardware or software) actor that actually generated the claim (aka the claim generator itself).

A claim generator may desire to provide a graphical representation of itself, referred here as an icon, to a Manifest Consumer that is presenting a user experience. The value of the icon field, if present, shall be a [hashed URI.](#page-37-2) This hashed URI shall be to an [embedded data assertion](#page-189-0) whose label is c2pa.icon and follows the [rules of assertion](#page-30-1) [labels](#page-30-1) with respect to multiple instances. Manifest Consumers should also support the [data box](#page-34-0) approach recommended by earlier versions of this specification.

**NOTE**

As with the assertions array, the hash algorithm used for a [hashed URI](#page-37-2) is determined by the alg field present in the hashed URI, or when absent, by an alg field in the claim.

## <span id="page-47-0"></span>**10.3. Creating a Claim**

## **10.3.1. Creating Assertions**

Before the claim can be finalized, all [assertions](#page-29-0) need to be created and stored in a newly created [C2PA Assertion Store](#page-58-0)

as described [later in this document.](#page-62-0)

When creating a standard manifest, it may not be possible to know all of the required binding information at the time of claim creation, in which case use the [multiple step processing method](#page-52-0) to setup and then later fill-in the information.

## **10.3.2. Preparing the Claim**

#### **10.3.2.1. Adding Assertions and Redactions**

The claim shall contain a created\_assertions field and may contain a gathered\_assertions field. The combined values from those two fields represent a list of all of the URI references for all assertions that were added to the assertion store that are being "claimed" by this claim. In a standard manifest, the created\_assertions field's value shall include at least one assertion that represents a [hard binding.](#page-41-2)

If any assertions in ingredient claims are being redacted, their URI references shall be added to list which is the value of the redacted\_assertions field.

#### <span id="page-48-1"></span>**10.3.2.2. Adding Ingredients**

In many authoring scenarios, an actor does not create an entirely new asset but instead brings in other existing assets on which to create their work - either as a derived asset, a composed asset or an asset rendition. These existing assets are called ingredients and their use is documented in the provenance data through the use of an [ingredient assertion](#page-209-0).

When an ingredient contains one or more C2PA manifests, those manifests should be inserted into this asset's C2PA Manifest Store to help ensure that the provenance data is kept intact. Such ingredient manifests are added to the JUMBF as described in [Section 11.1.4, "C2PA Box details"](#page-58-0). If a manifest with the same unique identifier is already present in the C2PA Manifest Store, the two shall be compared. If they are identical, the new manifest shall be ignored. If they are different, the new manifest shall be added to the store after changing its unique identifier to a new value as described in [Chapter 8,](#page-35-0) [Unique Identifiers](#page-35-0).

If an ingredient's manifest is [remote,](#page-64-1) and the claim generator is unable to retrieve the manifest, it should use an error code of manifest.inaccessible to reflect that.

#### **10.3.2.3. Connecting the Signature**

The signature cannot be part of the signed payload, but since its label is pre-defined, then the full URI reference is also known. As such, we can include that in the claim by setting the value of the signature field of the claim to that URI reference.

**NOTE** This provides the explicit binding of the claim to its signature.

#### <span id="page-48-0"></span>**10.3.2.4. Signing a Claim**

Producing the signature is specified in [Section 13.2, "Digital Signatures".](#page-68-0)

For both types of manifests, standard and update, the payload field of Sig\_structure shall be the serialized CBOR of the claim document, and shall use detached content mode.

The serialized COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged structure resulting from the digital signature procedure is written into the C2PA Claim Signature box.

#### <span id="page-49-1"></span>**10.3.2.5. Time-stamps**

#### **10.3.2.5.1. Use of RFC 3161**

If possible, the claim generator should use a RFC 3161-compliant Time Stamping Authority (TSA) [\(RFC 3161\)](http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3161) to obtain a trusted time-stamp proving that the signature itself actually existed at a certain date and time and incorporate that into the COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged structure as a countersignature.

Claim generators are encouraged to obtain and include time-stamps to ensure their manifests will remain valid. As described in [Chapter 15,](#page-82-0) [Validation](#page-82-0), manifests without time-stamps cease to be valid when the signing credential expires or becomes revoked. A manifest shall contain only one time-stamp.

**NOTE** Previous versions of this specification allowed for multiple time-stamps to be included in a manifest.

#### <span id="page-49-0"></span>**10.3.2.5.2. Choosing the Payload**

A previous version of this specification used the same value for the payload field in the time-stamp as was used in the Sig\_signature as described in [Section 10.3.2.4, "Signing a Claim"](#page-48-0). This payload is henceforth referred to as a "v1 payload" in a "v1 time-stamp" and is considered deprecated. A claim generator shall not create one, but a validator shall process one if present.

The "v2 payload", of the "v2 time-stamp", is the value of the signature field of the COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged structure created as part of [Section 10.3.2.4, "Signing a Claim"](#page-48-0). A "v2 payload" shall be used by claim generators performing a time-stamping operation.

**NOTE**

The value of the signature field includes the entire serialized bstr, including the bytes that indicate the major type and the length (not just the string itself).

#### <span id="page-49-2"></span>**10.3.2.5.3. Obtaining the time-stamp**

All time-stamps shall be obtained as described in [RFC 3161](http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3161) with the following additional requirements:

- The MessageImprint of the TimeStampReq structure [\(RFC 3161](http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3161), section 2.4.1) shall be computed by creating the ToBeSigned value in [RFC 8152](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152), section 4.4, with the following values for elements of Sig\_structure:
  - The context element shall be CounterSignature.
  - The payload element shall be the value described by [Section 10.3.2.5.2, "Choosing the Payload"](#page-49-0).
  - The remaining elements of Sig\_structure are as described in [Section 13.2.3, "Computing the Signature".](#page-69-0)
- The ToBeSigned value is then hashed using a hash algorithm from the allowed list in [Section 13.1, "Hashing"](#page-67-1) that the TSA supports, and that hash algorithm and value are placed in the MessageImprint. If the TSA does

not support any hash algorithms from the allowed list, it cannot be used for time-stamping.

- Where possible, the hash algorithm should use the same hash algorithm used in the digital signature of the claim.
- The certReq boolean of the TimeStampReq structure shall be asserted in the request to the TSA, to ensure its certificate chain is provided in the response.

#### **10.3.2.5.4. Storing the time-stamp**

v1 time-stamps (deprecated) are stored in a COSE unprotected header whose label is the string sigTst. If present, the value of this header shall be a tstContainer defined by [Example 2, "CDDL for](#page-50-0) [tstContainer](#page-50-0)["](#page-50-0). The content of the TimeStampResp structure received in reply from the TSA shall be stored as the value of the val property of an element of tstTokens.

v2 time-stamps shall be stored in a COSE unprotected header whose label is the string sigTst2. When present, the value of this header shall be a tstContainer defined by [Example 2, "CDDL for](#page-50-0) [tstContainer](#page-50-0)["](#page-50-0). The value of the timeStampToken field of the TimeStampResp structure received in reply from the TSA shall be stored as the value of the val property of an element of tstTokens. It shall be formatted as a DER-encoded [RFC 3161](http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3161) TimeStampToken wrapped in a CBOR byte string.

**NOTE**

A v2 time-stamp is equivalent to the "CTT" model of [COSE Header parameter for RFC 3161 Time-](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cose-tsa-tst-header-parameter/)[Stamp Tokens Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cose-tsa-tst-header-parameter/). It requires that the complete signature structure be completed prior to timestamping, thus enabling the time-stamp to serve as a countersignature on the entire signature structure, including the actual certificate.

If no time-stamps are included, then neither header (sigTst nor sigTst2) shall be present in the COSE unprotected header.

#### <span id="page-50-0"></span>Example 2. CDDL for tstContainer

```
; CBOR version of tstContainer and related structures based on JSON schema at 
; https://forge.etsi.org/rep/esi/x19_182_JAdES/raw/v1.1.1/19182-jsonSchema.json
tstContainer = {
  "tstTokens": [1* tstToken]
}
tstToken = {
  "val": bstr
}
```

**NOTE**

The above definition is a CBOR adaptation of a subset of the schema from [JAdES,](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119100_119199/11918201/01.01.01_60/ts_11918201v010101p.pdf) section 5.3.4 and [its JSON schema,](https://forge.etsi.org/rep/esi/x19_182_JAdES/raw/v1.1.1/19182-jsonSchema.json) except with the modification that the content of val is a byte string and not a Base64-encoded string.

#### **10.3.2.6. Credential Revocation Information**

If the signer's credential supports querying its online credential status, and the credential contains a pointer to a service to provide time-stamped credential status information, the claim generator should query the service, capture the response, and store it in the manner described for credentials in the [Trust Model.](#page-72-0) If credential revocation information is attached in this manner, a trusted time-stamp shall also be obtained after signing, as described in [Section 10.3.2.5, "Time-stamps".](#page-49-1)

## **10.3.3. Examples of Claims**

#### <span id="page-51-0"></span>**10.3.3.1. Single Claim**

Here is a visual representation of an image containing a single claim with multiple assertions that have been embedded inside it.

Figure 5. A single claim with assertions

#### **10.3.3.2. Multiple Claims**

In this example of creating a second claim for the [previous example](#page-51-0), one of the original assertions has been redacted from the previous claim. The visual representation for this scenario would look like:

![](_page_52_Figure_2.jpeg)

Figure 6. Redacting assertions in a secondary claim

## <span id="page-52-0"></span>**10.4. Multiple Step Processing**

Some asset file formats require file offsets of the C2PA Manifest Store and asset content to be fixed before the manifest is signed, so that content bindings will correctly align with the content they authenticate. Unfortunately, the size of a manifest and its signature cannot be precisely known until after signing, which could cause file offsets to change.

As an example, in [JPEG 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) files, the entire C2PA Manifest Store is required to appear in the file before the image data, and so its size will affect the file offsets of content being authenticated.

To accomplish this, a multiple step approach shall be taken, similar to how signatures in PDF are done.

## **10.4.1. Create content bindings**

When creating a [standard manifest,](#page-62-1) its claim shall include one or more content binding assertions in its list of assertions to ensure that the asset is tamper-evident.

Create the data hash assertion and add it to the assertion store taking into account the following considerations.

In many cases, such as with JPEG 1, it is not possible to hash the asset in its entirety because the manifest will be embedded in the middle of the file, so the size or location of manifest data will not be known at the time the asset hash is computed. This circular dependency is avoided by allowing exclusion ranges to be specified during hashing. When exclusion ranges are specified, a single hash is performed, but only over the asset ranges that are not in any of the exclusions.

If a manifest is embedded in the center of a JPEG 1 file in an APP11 segment, then the claim creator may exclude the APP11 segment(s) from the hash calculation.

In order to prevent insertion attacks, it is desirable to have only a single exclusion range when possible. When the size or location (or both) of the manifest in the asset is not known, then the start and length values in the data hash assertion shall both be zero and the size of the pad value should be large enough to accommodate writing in the values during the second pass. At least 16 bytes is recommended. The value of the pad key shall consist of all 0x00's.

If padding is employed, it is possible that the pad data could be changed without resulting in a validation failure. Claim generators shall ensure that changes to pad data (or any other excluded asset data) cannot change how the asset is interpreted.

**NOTE**

In the case of JPEG 1 files, this can be achieved either by eliminating padding or by ensuring that the JFIF APP11/C2PA segments cannot be shortened of changed to a different segment type. This is accomplished by including all the C2PA manifest segment headers (APP11) and 2-byte length fields in the data-hash-map for all manifest-containing segments. Doing so ensures that any data changed in the exclusion region will not be misinterpreted by JPEG processors.

## <span id="page-53-0"></span>**10.4.2. Create a temporary Claim and Signature**

Add the newly created data hash assertion reference to the claim's assertion list providing a temporary hash value, such as empty spaces.

At this point, the temporary claim is complete and can be added to the C2PA Manifest being created.

Since the claim is only temporary at this time, it is not possible to sign it. To ensure the claim signature box contains a valid CBOR structure, create a temporary COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged structure as described in [RFC 8152](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152), section 4.2. The COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged is a tag byte followed by a COSE\_Sign1 structure, which is a four-element CBOR array. Construct the array as follows:

• The first element is the protected header bucket [\(RFC 8152](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152), section 3). Create an empty bucket by placing a bstr of size 0 in this position.

- The second element is the unprotected header bucket, which is a CBOR map. Create a map of 1 pair. Use the string pad as the label, and place a bstr of the desired padding size filled with zero bytes (0x00) as the value. A 25 kilobyte size is recommended for the initial size of this padding.
- The third element is the payload. Place the value nil (CBOR major type 7, value 22) here.
- The fourth element is signature. Place a bstr of size 0 here.

### **10.4.3. Complete the C2PA Manifest**

At this point all of the boxes that comprise the entire C2PA Manifest for the asset are completed and can be (if not already) constructed into its final form. The asset's C2PA Manifest, along with the manifests of any ingredients, are combined together to form the complete C2PA Manifest Store. The active manifest is required to be the last C2PA Manifest superbox in the C2PA Manifest Store superbox. The C2PA Manifest Store can then be embedded into the asset as discussed in [Section 11.3, "Embedding manifests into various file formats"](#page-64-0).

## **10.4.4. Going back and filling in**

Now that the C2PA Manifest Store has been embedded into the asset, the starting offset and the length of the active manifest can be updated in its data hash assertion. It is necessary that when doing so, you do not change the size of the assertion's box, only its data. This is done by adjusting the value of the pad field to be the necessary length to "fill up" the remaining bytes.

**NOTE**

Preferred/deterministic CBOR serialization of pad uses a variable length integer to specify the length of the encoded binary data. When the length goes from zero to 1 byte, or 1 to 2 bytes (etc.), the length of the resulting pad jumps by two bytes. This means that not all paddings can be expressed using a single padding field. For example, 24-byte and 26-byte pads can be created, but a 25-byte pad cannot. If this situation arises, the desired padding can be split between pad and pad2. For example, to make a 25-byte pad, a claim generator can encode 19 bytes into pad (resulting in an encoded length of 20 bytes), and 4 bytes into pad2 (resulting in 5 bytes.)

Once the data hash assertion has been updated, it can be hashed and the hash written over the empty spaces that were used previously to hold the location.

The claim is now complete, and it can be hashed and signed as described in [Section 10.3.2.4, "Signing a Claim"](#page-48-0), with the resultant signature filling the pre-allocated space. The pad header can then be shrunk as required so that the claim signature box remains the same size; because this header is unprotected, changing it does not invalidate the claim signature.

If the serialized COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged structure exceeds the reserved size of the C2PA Claim Signature box, multiple step processing shall be repeated with a larger padding size chosen in [Section 10.4.2, "Create a temporary Claim and](#page-53-0) [Signature"](#page-53-0). Revocation information retrieved during the previous attempt should be reusable if it is still within its validity interval ([RFC 6960](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960), section 4.2.2.1), but a new time-stamp will be required on the new claim with the file offsets changed as the result of added padding.

A C2PA Manifest may contain assertions defined outside of this specification, and they could depend on file layout. As

| change once the assertion has been finalized. | such, the claim generator may no longer be able to change the file layout and/or offsets in a data hash assertion. In<br>this case, claim generators should use padding prior to assertion creation to ensure that the file layout need not |

# <span id="page-56-0"></span>**Chapter 11. Manifests**

## <span id="page-56-1"></span>**11.1. Use of JUMBF**

## **11.1.1. Rationale**

In order to support many of the requirements of C2PA, C2PA Manifests needed to be stored (serialized) into a structured binary data store that enables some specific functionality including:

- Ability to store multiple manifests (e.g., parents and ingredients) in a single container.
- Ability to refer to individual elements (both within and across manifests) via URIs.
- Ability to clearly identify the parts of an element to be hashed.
- Ability to store pre-defined data types used by C2PA (e.g., JSON and CBOR).
- Ability to store arbitrary data formats (e.g., XML, JPEG, etc.).

In addition to supporting all of the requirements above, our chosen container format - ISO 19566-5:2023 (JUMBF) - is also natively supported by the JPEG family of formats and is compatible with the box-based model (i.e., [ISOBMFF, ISO](https://www.iso.org/standard/68960.html) [14496-12](https://www.iso.org/standard/68960.html)) used by many common image and video file formats. Using JUMBF enables all the same benefits (and a few extras, such as [URI References\)](#page-37-0) while being able to work with classic image formats, such as JPEG/JFIF and PNG as well as 3D and document (e.g., PDF) formats. This serialized format shall be used also in formats that do not natively support JUMBF, or when C2PA Manifest Stores are stored separately from the asset, such as in a separate file or URI location.

> Since most of the standard assertions, as well the claim signature, are serialized as CBOR, using CBOR for the entire C2PA Manifest was considered but not chosen because CBOR is not a container format.

## **NOTE**

For example, to store a "blob of JSON" inside of CBOR, and know that it is JSON (and not some other format) would necessitate designing a data structure for storing such things. Then the parent structure would need to be defined as to how to carry that structure. This same concept would also have to be done for each of the native features of JUMBF.

While it would certainly be possible to re-implement all of the required functionality entirely in CBOR, it would be a lot of work and would not fully remove the need for a JUMBF/BMFF parser in all implementations.

## **11.1.2. Processing Rules**

A C2PA Manifest Consumer shall never process an assertion, assertion store, claim, claim signature or C2PA Manifest that is not contained inside of a C2PA Manifest Store. Additionally, when a C2PA Manifest Consumer encounters a JUMBF box or superbox whose JUMBF type UUID it does not recognize, it shall skip over (and ignore) its contents.

**NOTE**

This means that the C2PA Manifest Consumer can process private boxes that it knows about, but ignore ones of which it is unaware.

If the Requestable and Label Present toggles are both set in the JUMBF Description box of any JUMBF box or superbox, that box or superbox shall be maintained in any updated C2PA Manifest Store.

**NOTE**

Boxes with those toggles set are intended to be referenced via JUMBF URIs, and their removal could cause downstream workflows to fail.

## **11.1.3. Extensions**

#### **11.1.3.1. General**

This section describes extensions to the JUMBF specification (ISO 19566-5:2023) required by this specification.

#### <span id="page-57-0"></span>**11.1.3.2. Compressed boxes**

<span id="page-57-1"></span>In order to support compressing manifests, a new brob content box is supported by C2PA. Based on a similar box in JPEG-XL (ISO/IEC 18181-2:2024), the brob box is a content box whose contents are the [Brotli-compressed](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7932) bytes of either a [standard manifest](#page-62-1) or [update manifest,](#page-63-0) as described in the [compressed manifests](#page-64-2) clause. The brob box shall have box ID of 0x62726F62 (brob).

![](_page_57_Figure_10.jpeg)

Figure 7. Example of a compressed manifest

Hashing a compressed box is done in the same way as any other box, as described in [Section 8.4.2.3, "Hashing JUMBF](#page-39-0) [Boxes".](#page-39-0)

**NOTE**

This implies that given a hashed\_uri reference from an ingredient assertion to a C2PA Manifest via the activeManifest field, the hash is computed using the same process as any other JUMBF superbox: over the JUMBF Description Box and the brob box with its compressed payload, but excluding the superbox's header. The contents of the brob box are not decompressed first to compute the hash.

### <span id="page-58-0"></span>**11.1.4. C2PA Box details**

#### **11.1.4.1. JUMBF Description boxes**

#### <span id="page-58-1"></span>**11.1.4.1.1. Labels**

As described in the JUMBF specification (ISO 19566-5:2023, A.3), a label shall be stored as ISO/IEC 10646 characters in the UTF-8 encoding. Characters in the ranges U+0000 to U+001F inclusive and U+007F to U+009F inclusive, as well as the specific characters '/', ';', '?', and '#', are not permitted in the label. The label shall be null-terminated.

As labels used as part of JUMBF URIs, the characters U+FEFF, U+FFFF, and U+D800-U+DFFF shall also not be used.

#### **11.1.4.1.2. Toggles**

All JUMBF Description boxes (ISO 19566-5:2023, A.3) used in a C2PA Manifest require a label, the Label Present toggle (xxxxxx1x) shall be set. In addition, because JUMBF URIs are used to refer to boxes throughout the system (e.g., listing assertions, references to ingredients, etc.), the Requestable toggle (xxxxxx11) shall be set.

When including a salt in a PRIVATE box as described in [Section 8.4.2.3, "Hashing JUMBF Boxes"](#page-39-0), the Private toggle (xxx1xxxx) shall also be set.

#### <span id="page-58-2"></span>**11.1.4.2. Manifest Store**

C2PA data is serialized into a JUMBF-compatible box structure. The outermost box is referred to as the C2PA Manifest Store, also known as the Content Credentials. [Figure 8, "C2PA Manifest Store"](#page-59-0) is an example C2PA Manifest Store with a single C2PA Manifest:

<span id="page-59-0"></span>![](_page_59_Picture_0.jpeg)

Figure 8. C2PA Manifest Store

The C2PA Manifest Store is a JUMBF superbox composed of a series of other JUMBF boxes and superboxes, each identified by their own JUMBF type UUID and label in their JUMBF Description box. The C2PA Manifest Store shall have a label of c2pa, a JUMBF type UUID of 63327061-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2pa) and shall contain one or more C2PA manifest superboxes, also known as C2PA Manifests, the last of which is the [active](#page-12-6) [manifest.](#page-12-6) The C2PA Manifest Store may also contain JUMBF boxes and superboxes whose JUMBF type UUIDs are not defined in this specification.

**NOTE**

Allowing other boxes and superboxes enables custom extensions to C2PA as well as enabling the addition of new boxes in future versions of this specification without breaking compatibility.

Each C2PA Manifest shall contain the data created at the time a claim is issued including the C2PA Assertion Store, a C2PA Claim, and a C2PA Claim Signature. A C2PA Manifest may also contain JUMBF boxes and superboxes whose JUMBF type UUIDs are not defined in this specification.

The JUMBF type UUID for each C2PA Manifest shall be either 63326D61-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2ma), 6332636D-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2cm) or 6332756D-0011-0010-8000- 00AA00389B71 (c2um) depending on the [type of manifest.](#page-62-0) The C2PA Manifest box shall be labelled with a urn:c2pa value computed as described in [Unique Identifiers](#page-35-0).

#### **11.1.4.3. Assertion Store**

The C2PA [Assertion Store](#page-31-1) is a superbox that shall have a label of c2pa.assertions and a JUMBF type UUID of

63326173-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2as). It shall contain one or more JUMBF superboxes (called C2PA Assertion boxes) whose JUMBF type defines the type of the sub-boxes that contain the assertion data (ISO 19566-5:2023, Annex B). These superboxes shall each have a label as defined in [Standard Assertions](#page-133-0) and shall contain a JUMBF Description Box, one or more JUMBF Content Boxes and possibly a Padding Box (ISO 19566-5:2023, A.4).

The JUMBF Content Type (ISO 19566-5:2023, Annex B) box(es) contained in each assertion superbox should be CBOR Content Type (cbor), JSON Content Type (json), Embedded File Content Type (bfdb & bidb) or UUID Content Type (uuid) though any Content Type defined in JUMBF (ISO 19566-5:2023) and its amendments is permitted. In addition, a JUMBF Protection Box as described in ISO 19566-4:2020 may also be used.

**NOTE**

Custom assertions containing other formats/serializations of data, such as encrypted data, are supported through the use of a UUID Content Box containing the custom UUID followed by the data (ISO 19566-5:2023, B.5).

#### **11.1.4.4. Claim and Claim Signature**

The C2PA [Claim](#page-44-0) box shall have a label of c2pa.claim.v2, a JUMBF type UUID of 6332636C-0011-0010-8000- 00AA00389B71 (c2cl) and shall consist of a single CBOR Content Type box (cbor).

The C2PA [Claim Signature](#page-68-0) box shall have a label of c2pa.signature, a JUMBF type UUID of 63326373-0011- 0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2cs) and shall consist of a single CBOR Content Type box (cbor).

#### <span id="page-60-0"></span>**11.1.4.5. Ingredient Storage**

When a C2PA Manifest includes [ingredient assertions,](#page-209-0) and an ingredient contains a C2PA Manifest Store, the C2PA Manifests it contains are normally included in the C2PA Manifest Store of the new asset to ensure that the provenance data is kept intact, as described in [Section 10.3.2.2, "Adding Ingredients"](#page-48-1).

![](_page_61_Figure_0.jpeg)

#### <span id="page-61-0"></span>**11.1.4.6. Data Storage**

## **IMPORTANT**

This section is retained for historical purposes. The concept of a data box has been deprecated in favor of a standard assertion that uses a standard JUMBF Embedded File content type box to contain the data. For more information about the embedded data assertion, see [Section 18.12, "Embedded Data"](#page-189-0).

A C2PA Data Box Store is a JUMBF superbox that shall contain only one or more CBOR Content Type boxes (cbor). It shall not contain any other type of JUMBF box or superbox. It shall have a label of c2pa.databoxes and a JUMBF type UUID of 63326462-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2db).

The CBOR Content Type boxes shall have a label of c2pa.data (for [embedded data](#page-34-0)).

Figure 10. C2PA Manifest Store with Data Boxes

## <span id="page-62-0"></span>**11.2. Types of Manifests**

## **11.2.1. Commonalities**

All C2PA Manifests shall contain an [assertion store](#page-31-1) with at least one [assertion,](#page-29-0) a [claim](#page-44-0) and a [claim signature](#page-48-0).

## <span id="page-62-1"></span>**11.2.2. Standard Manifests**

A standard C2PA Manifest (JUMBF type UUID: 63326D61-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2ma)) shall contain exactly one [hard binding to content](#page-41-0) assertion - either a c2pa.hash.data, c2pa.hash.boxes, c2pa.hash.collection.data, c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 (deprecated), or c2pa.hash.bmff.v3 based on the type of asset and version for which the manifest is destined. Because of this requirement, they are the predominant type of manifest that will be present in C2PA provenance data.

Manifest Consumers shall also accept standard C2PA Manifests specified with JUMBF type UUID 63326D64-0011- 0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2md), but claim generators shall not create manifests with this JUMBF type UUID.

### <span id="page-63-0"></span>**11.2.3. Update Manifests**

There are, however, provenance workflows where additional assertions need to be added but the digital content is not changed. In these workflows, an Update Manifest (JUMBF type UUID: 6332756D-0011-0010-8000- 00AA00389B71 (c2um)) should be used.

An Update Manifest shall not contain assertions of types c2pa.hash.data, c2pa.hash.boxes, c2pa.hash.collection.data, c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 (deprecated), or c2pa.hash.bmff.v3 because the content has not changed and therefore the bindings need not be updated. In the case of a file offset hash (c2pa.hash.data), the C2PA Manifest Store has to continue to start at the same file offset after updating - only its length may change. In addition, it shall not contain a c2pa.hash.multi-asset assertion.

An Update Manifest may contain assertions of type c2pa.actions or c2pa.actions.v2, provided that the value of the action field of each action present in the actions array of these assertions shall only be one of the following values:

- c2pa.edited.metadata
- c2pa.opened
- c2pa.published
- c2pa.redacted

An Update Manifest shall not contain an assertion of type c2pa.actions or c2pa.actions.v2 that contains an action field outside of this list.

An Update Manifest may contain either a [time-stamp assertion,](#page-224-0) a [certificate status assertion](#page-225-0) or both.

**NOTE** This is the replacement approach for the deprecated [time-stamp manifests](#page-64-3) feature.

An Update Manifest shall not contain a [thumbnail assertion](#page-190-0).

**NOTE** The reason for these requirements is that an action field outside of this list or a thumbnail implies changes to the digital content.

The Update Manifest shall contain exactly one c2pa.ingredient.v3 assertion that (a) includes both activeManifest and claimSignature fields with values that are the [URI references](#page-37-0) to the C2PA Manifest and Claim Signature respectively (or one c2pa.ingredient.v2 or c2pa.ingredient that includes a c2pa\_manifest field) of the asset that is being updated and (b) has the value of parentOf for the relationship field.

**NOTE** The ingredient's C2PA Manifest can be either a standard manifest or an update manifest.

## <span id="page-64-2"></span>**11.2.4. Compressed Manifests**

Standard and Update Manifests can be compressed, in their entirety, using the [Brotli compression algorithm](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7932) as described [above.](#page-57-0) For either type of manifest, the value of the TYPE field shall be c2cm, the value of the [label field](#page-58-1) shall be the identical to the label of the compressed manifest superbox, and the contents of the brob content box shall be the compressed bytes of the entire manifest superbox. See [Figure 7, "Example of a compressed manifest"](#page-57-1) for an example of a compressed standard manifest.

**IMPORTANT**

Any place in this specification that a standard or update manifest is referenced, a compressed standard or update manifest is also valid.

## <span id="page-64-3"></span>**11.2.5. Time-Stamp Manifests (HISTORICAL)**

**IMPORTANT**

This feature has been deprecated in favor of the [time-stamp assertion](#page-224-0) and is not to be written by claim generators nor read by manifest consumers. Instead, a [time-stamp assertion](#page-224-0) is used to accomplish the same goals.

**NOTE** The information below is retained for historical purposes.

In some provenance workflows, a standard or update manifest is created offline, where it is not possible to obtain a trusted time-stamp (as per [RFC 3161](http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3161)) from a TSA at the time of signing. In order to accommodate this, it is possible to use a Time-Stamp Manifest (JUMBF type UUID: 6332746D-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2tm)) to add the time-stamp in a later operation when a TSA can be contacted.

## <span id="page-64-0"></span>**11.3. Embedding manifests into various file formats**

A C2PA Manifest can be embedded into a variety of file formats covering media types including images, videos, audio, fonts, and documents. [Appendix A,](#page-251-0) [Embedding manifests](#page-251-0) provides the technical details on how to embed C2PA Manifests into each specifically supported file format.

**NOTE**

Many classic image formats such as BMP do not support the embedding of arbitrary data, so the use of an [external manifest](#page-64-1) is required.

## <span id="page-64-1"></span>**11.4. External Manifests**

In some cases, it may not be possible (or practical) to embed a C2PA Manifest Store in an asset. In those cases, keeping the C2PA Manifests externally to the asset is an acceptable model for providing provenance to assets. The C2PA Manifest should be stored in a location, referred to as a manifest repository, that is easily locatable by a Manifest Consumer working with the asset, such as [by reference or URI.](#page-96-0) As the C2PA Manifest Store is a JUMBF box, it shall be served with the JUMBF Media Type, application/c2pa.

**NOTE**

Previous versions of this specification used the media type application/x-c2pa-manifeststore for the C2PA Manifest Store. That media type is deprecated.

Some common reasons to use an external manifest are:

- It may not be technically possible, such as with a .txt file.
- It may not be practical, such as when the size of the C2PA Manifest Store is larger than the asset's digital content.
- It may not be appropriate, such as when it would modify an asset that should not be modified.

**NOTE** a good example of this is creating a manifest for a pre-existing asset.

## <span id="page-65-0"></span>**11.5. Embedding a Reference to an external Manifest**

If the asset has embedded XMP, and the C2PA Manifest will be stored externally, it is recommended that the claim generator add a [dcterms:provenance](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#http://purl.org/dc/terms/provenance) key to the XMP, the value (a URI reference) being where to locate the active manifest.

**NOTE**

A previous version of this specification also recommended using this method for references to embedded manifests. Now this mechanism is only for external manifests.

Since fonts do not support XMP, an equivalent method for specifying a URI to a remote C2PA Manifest Store is described in [this clause on fonts.](#page-256-0)

# <span id="page-67-0"></span>**Chapter 13. Cryptography**

## <span id="page-67-1"></span>**13.1. Hashing**

All cryptographic hashes that are applied as per the technical requirements of this specification shall be generated using one of the hash algorithms as described in this section. This section defines both:

- A list of hash algorithms that are allowed for generating hashes of new content as well as required for validating hashes of existing content (the allowed list);
- A list of hash algorithms that are required to be supported for validating hashes of existing content but are not allowed for generating hashes of new content (the deprecated list).

**NOTE** This section does not govern algorithms used for soft bindings as described in [Section 18.10, "Soft](#page-180-0) [Binding"](#page-180-0). **NOTE** This section does not govern algorithms used by custom assertions that are defined outside of this specification.

An algorithm shall appear in no more than one list. An algorithm that is instantiated over multiple output lengths (such as the various lengths of SHA2) will each be considered different algorithms, and each instantiation shall be listed separately. If an algorithm does not appear in either list, it is forbidden and shall not be used or supported. Algorithms can be removed from the lists in order to implement forbidding an algorithm. For this reason, implementations shall not support additional algorithms on an optional basis.

Implementers should consult this section in the current version of the specification when releasing software updates and ensure their supported algorithms conform to it.

These lists establish the allowed algorithms for creating hashes and a string algorithm identifier to be used as the algorithm identifier (usually called alg) in the corresponding field of C2PA data structures. The outputs of hash functions shall be stored as their binary values encoded into CBOR as byte strings (major type 2) with a declared length. Wherever a field contains the output of a hash function, an algorithm identifier string field shall be present within the same structure, or within an enclosing structure, or in the claim-map or claim-map-v2 structure to declare which algorithm was used. A hash algorithm identifier field should be present in exactly one of these places, but if more than one is present within the structure and its enclosing structures, the nearest identifier shall be used. Nearest is defined first as an identifier that is a sibling field of the hash value, and then the immediately enclosing structure, up to the root structure. If no identifier is present in any of these places, then the alg field from the claim-map or claim-map-v2 structure shall be used.

#### The allowed list is:

- SHA2-256 ("sha256");
- SHA2-384 ("sha384");
- SHA2-512 ("sha512").

**NOTE**

The SHA-3 family of hash algorithms are not on the allowed list for consistency with the digital signature algorithm allowed list, because COSE has not yet established digital signature algorithms that use a SHA-3 algorithm as the hash algorithm.

The deprecated list is empty.

## <span id="page-68-0"></span>**13.2. Digital Signatures**

All digital signatures applied as per the technical requirements of this specification shall be generated using one of the digital signature algorithms and key types listed as described in this section. This section defines both:

- A list of digital signature algorithms and key types that are allowed for generating signatures for new claim signatures as well as required for validating existing claim signatures (the allowed list);
- A list of digital signature algorithms and key types that are required to be supported for validating existing claim signatures but are not allowed for generating new claim signatures (the deprecated list).

**NOTE**

This section does not govern digital signatures used by custom assertions that are defined outside of this specification.

These lists establish the allowed algorithms and key types by referencing an algorithm identifier from the relevant standards that define algorithms for COSE and their mappings to CBOR identifiers, including but not limited to [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152) [8152](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152) and [RFC 8230.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8230/) These standards also specify the hash algorithm used in the signature scheme. Nothing in [Section](#page-67-1) [13.1, "Hashing"](#page-67-1) shall apply to this use of hash algorithms; if a digital signature algorithm is present in the digital signature algorithm and key type [below,](#page-68-1) the use of its specified hash algorithm in the signature scheme shall be allowed and followed.

**NOTE** Parenthetical notes in the lists below are explainers provided only as an aid to the reader.

### <span id="page-68-1"></span>**13.2.1. Signature Algorithms**

The allowed list is:

- ES256 (ECDSA with SHA-256);
- ES384 (ECDSA with SHA-384);
- ES512 (ECDSA with SHA-512);
- PS256 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-256 and MGF1 with SHA-256);
- PS384 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-384 and MGF1 with SHA-384);
- PS512 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-512 and MGF1 with SHA-512);
- EdDSA (Edwards-Curve DSA).
  - Ed25519 instance only. No other EdDSA instances are allowed.

The deprecated list is empty.

Implementations are required to check that keys provided for signing or verification operations are correct for the chosen algorithm, as required by [RFC 8152](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152), section 8.1 for ECDSA, [RFC 8152,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152) section 8.2 for EdDSA, and [RFC 8230](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8230.html#section-2) [section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8230.html#section-2) and [section 4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8230.html#section-4) for RSASSA-PSS.

These requirements are summarized here for convenience:

- ECDSA requires elliptic curve keys on the P-256, P-384, or P-521 elliptic curves.
  - Although it is recommended to use P-256 keys with ES256, P-384 keys with ES384, and P-521 keys with ES512, it is not required. Implementations shall accept keys on any of these curves for all ECDSA algorithm choices.
- Ed25519 requires elliptic curve keys on the edwards25519 elliptic curve.
- RSASSA-PSS requires RSA keys with a modulus length of at least 2048 bits.

Implementations shall refuse to generate or verify signatures with keys that are not correct for the algorithm choice. Implementations may refuse RSA keys with modulus length greater than 16384 bits.

## **13.2.2. Use of COSE**

The signature for the CBOR-encoded claim is produced by CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) as described in [RFC 8152](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152), sections 4.2 and 4.4.

**NOTE**

Payloads can either be present inside a COSE signature, or transported separately ("detached content" as described in [RFC 8152,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152) section 4.1). In "detached content" mode, the signed data is stored externally to the COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged structure, and the payload field of the COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged structure is always nil.

Regardless of whether the payload will be present in or detached from the COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged signature; the contents of the payload field of Sig\_structure in memory, when constructed to compute or verify a digital signature, shall be populated with that external data as described by the particular use of digital signature in this specification. The payload field of Sig\_structure shall never be nil.

When computing or verifying the signature of a standard or update manifest, the payload field of the Sig\_structure will contain the contents of the claim JUMBF box, as described in [Section 10.3.2.4, "Signing a](#page-48-0) [Claim"](#page-48-0) and [Section 11.1, "Use of JUMBF"](#page-56-1).

## <span id="page-69-0"></span>**13.2.3. Computing the Signature**

The signature is computed or verified as described in [RFC 8152](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152), section 4.4. The following additional requirements apply to the construction of Sig\_structure:

- The value for the context element shall be Signature1 except where a particular use of digital signatures in this specification specifies using CounterSignature instead. Signature shall not be used.
- The value for the payload element will be specified by each use of digital signatures in this specification.

- The external\_aad element shall be a bstr of length zero. External authenticated data shall not be used.
- The alg header specifying the signature algorithm shall be present in the body\_protected element as defined in [RFC 8152,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152) section 3.1.

**NOTE**

The alg header is a standard COSE header, and therefore is always included in the protected header map with the integer 1 as its label, as established in the [IANA COSE Header Parameters](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml#header-parameters) [Registry.](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml#header-parameters) The literal string alg is never used as the label. The sign\_protected element is always omitted when using COSE\_Sign1.

All digital signatures in C2PA structures shall be a COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged structure as defined in [RFC 8152](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152), section 4.2. COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged contains a COSE\_Sign1 structure. The following additional requirements apply to the construction of COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged:

- The same alg header in the Sig\_structure above shall be present in the protected header bucket.
- The value for the payload field and whether the payload is present in the signature or detached will be specified by each use of digital signatures in this specification. When the payload is specified as detached, its value here shall be nil. Conversely, when the payload is present in the signature, the binary contents of the payload are stored in this field as a bstr.

**NOTE**

COSE defines nil to be major type 7, value 22 in [RFC 8152](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152), section 1.3, and uses this value exclusively for detached content. A byte array (major type 2) of length zero cannot be used to indicate detached content.

## <span id="page-70-0"></span>**13.2.4. Adding a claimed time of signing**

A claim generator may also wish to establish a "claimed time of signing" by adding an iat protected header, whose value is a NumericDate. If present, it shall represent the time at which the signature was generated.

**NOTE**

A NumericDate is a CBOR numeric date (as described in [RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), section 3.4.2) but with the leading tag 1 (epoch-based date/time) omitted. It is not used anywhere else in this specification.

**NOTE**

This recommendation is based on in-process updates to [JAdES](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119100_119199/11918201/01.01.01_60/ts_11918201v010101p.pdf) for providing a non-trusted timestamp that is not used for certificate validity checking, but could be used in a user experience. It could be useful in scenarios where the claim generator is not able to access a trusted time source, but still wants to provide a time of signing.

## **13.2.5. Signature Validation**

When producing a signature, if the claim generator can also act as a validator, the claim generator should validate that the signing credential is acceptable according to [Chapter 14,](#page-72-0) [Trust Model](#page-72-0) and produce a warning if it is not. The claim generator may still allow signing with that credential if so desired. This may be desirable if it is known that the local claim generator's validator has a different configuration than validators used by the expected audience of the asset.

## <span id="page-71-0"></span>**13.2.6. Cryptographic validation**

When verifying a signature, an in-memory Sig\_structure is generated. Its body\_protected field is populated with the contents of the protected header bucket from the COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged structure ([RFC 8152](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152), section 4.4). For the payload field, if the payload was specified as present in the signature, it is populated from the payload field of the COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged structure. If the payload was specified as detached, the payload field of the COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged structure will be nil. In this case, the contents of the payload field of Sig\_structure shall be populated from the same external source that was used in the generation of the signature. These are defined in the places where the digital signature is used in this specification.

### **13.2.7. Inclusion of signer icons**

A C2PA Manifest Consumer may wish to display an icon or logo for the signer. To locate such a graphic, it shall look inside the embedded certificate for a logotype as defined in [RFC 9399.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9399/) If no logotype is present, the Manifest Consumer may use icons or logos from other sources in an implementation-dependent manner.

# <span id="page-72-0"></span>**Chapter 14. Trust Model**

**NOTE**

In this section, "user" refers to human actors that are using C2PA-compliant validators in consumption and authoring scenarios.

## <span id="page-72-1"></span>**14.1. Overview**

<span id="page-72-3"></span>![](_page_72_Figure_4.jpeg)

Figure 12. C2PA Trust Model Diagram

[Figure 12, "C2PA Trust Model Diagram"](#page-72-3) shows, in yellow, green and red, the three entities specified in the trust model, which is concerned with trust in a signer's identity. In dashed lines, below, is the consumer (who is not specified in the trust model), who uses the identity of the signer, along with other trust signals, to decide whether the assertions made about an asset are true.

## <span id="page-72-2"></span>**14.2. Identity of Signers**

Identity in the trust model is the means by which a cryptographic signing key (aka credential) is associated with the signer for the basis of making trust decisions based on the claim signature or any structure (including, but not limited to, assertions and claims) signed with that key.

The credential shall be listed in the COSE protected headers of the COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged structure used for digital signatures in all C2PA manifests. Exactly one instance of an identity credential shall appear in the union of the protected and unprotected headers. COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged structures with no credentials, or two or more credentials, shall be rejected. Repeating the same credential more than once, including separately in the protected and unprotected headers, is also an instance of two or more credentials and shall be rejected.

**NOTE**

Older versions of this specification also allowed the credential to appear in the COSE unprotected headers.

How the credential is stored in the header value, how trust chains are constructed are specified, and additional information can be found in [Section 14.5, "X.509 Certificates"](#page-75-0).

## <span id="page-73-0"></span>**14.3. Validation states**

### **14.3.1. General**

A validator is a Manifest Consumer that will make some [validation](#page-82-0) statements about that asset and its associated active manifest. The process for retrieving these statements is described in the [validation section](#page-82-0). The actor consuming the asset, usually through their user agent and its user interface, then has to interpret those statements to arrive at a set of conclusions of their own about the provenance of the asset they are consuming. These conclusions will be drawn from those statements and the contents of the asset itself.

## **14.3.2. Manifest States**

Based on these statements, a C2PA Manifest may be one of the following:

- [Well-Formed](#page-73-1)
- [Valid](#page-73-2)
- [Trusted](#page-74-1)

## <span id="page-73-3"></span>**14.3.3. Asset States**

If a validator reports that the portions of the asset that are covered by content bindings have not been modified since the active manifest was produced [\[Section 15.12, "Validate the Asset's Content"](#page-118-0)], and its active manifest is either [Valid](#page-73-2) or [Trusted,](#page-74-1) then the asset itself is a Valid asset.

## <span id="page-73-1"></span>**14.3.4. Well-Formed Manifest**

A C2PA Manifest is Well-Formed if validation determines that each of the following is true:

**NOTE** Any Trusted manifest is also Valid, and any Valid manifest is also Well-Formed.

- The manifest's contents abide by the normative requirements of this specification, that are validated via the [validation process](#page-82-1).
- Only those assertions allowed for the [specific type](#page-62-0) of the manifest are present [[Section 15.10.1, "Validate the](#page-104-1) [correct assertions for the type of manifest"](#page-104-1)].
- The assertions of the manifest meet all the requirements for assertions [\[Section 15.10.3, "Assertion Validation"](#page-105-0)].
- Any ingredients present in the manifest meet all the requirements for ingredients [[Section 15.11, "Validate the](#page-112-0) [Ingredients"\]](#page-112-0).

## <span id="page-73-2"></span>**14.3.5. Valid Manifest**

A C2PA Manifest is Valid if validation determines that each of the following is true:

- The manifest is Well-Formed [\[Section 14.3.4, "Well-Formed Manifest"](#page-73-1)].
- The manifest has not been modified since the manifest was signed [\[Section 13.2.6, "Cryptographic validation"\]](#page-71-0).
- The claim signature receives a success code of claimSignature.validated [\[Section 15.7, "Validate the](#page-98-1) [Signature"](#page-98-1)].
- Validation of the claim signature validity period receives the success code of claimSignature.insideValidity [\[Section 15.8, "Validate the Time-Stamp"](#page-99-0)].
- The credential of the signer of the C2PA Manifest is not rejected with a failure code of signingCredential.ocsp.revoked [[Section 15.9, "Validate the Credential Revocation Information"](#page-102-0)].

If a C2PA Manifest is Valid, then the manifest's claim can be attributed to the claim generator which is identified by the claim\_generator\_info field of the claim [[Section 10.2.3, "Claim Generator Info"\]](#page-47-1).

## <span id="page-74-1"></span>**14.3.6. Trusted Manifest**

A C2PA Manifest is Trusted if validation determines that each of the following is true:

- The manifest is Valid [[Section 14.3.5, "Valid Manifest"](#page-73-2)].
- The signing credential of the C2PA Manifest receives the success code of signingCredential.trusted [\[Section 15.7, "Validate the Signature"\]](#page-98-1).

## <span id="page-74-0"></span>**14.4. Trust Lists**

## <span id="page-74-2"></span>**14.4.1. C2PA Signers**

A validator shall maintain the following information for evaluating C2PA signers:

- A list of accepted Extended Key Usage (EKU) values.
- For each accepted EKU value, a list of "trust anchor configurations".

An individual trust anchor configuration shall include the X.509 certificate for that trust anchor. Additionally, the configuration should include a "notBefore" date/time, before which there is no trust for that trust anchor configuration. If the trust for that trust anchor configuration has ended, it should also include a "notAfter" date/time, after which there is no trust for that configuration.

If a "notBefore" date/time is present, the trust anchor configuration shall not be used for claim signatures whose timestamp (or current time, if no timestamp is present) is before that date/time. If a "notAfter" date/time is present, the trust anchor configuration shall not be used for claim signatures whose timestamp (or current time, if no timestamp is present) is after that date/time.

For the c2pa-kp-claimSigning (1.3.6.1.4.1.62558.2.1) EKU, the list of trust anchor configurations shall include, but need not be limited to, the signer trust anchor configurations provided by C2PA (i.e., the C2PA Trust List).

In addition to the list of trust anchor configurations for the c2pa-kp-claimSigning EKU provided in the C2PA Trust List, a validator should allow a user to configure additional trust anchor configurations for that EKU and/or for other EKUs (e.g., id-kp-emailProtection (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4) or id-kp-documentSigning (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.36)). A validator should provide default options or offer lists maintained by external parties that the user may opt into to populate the validator's trust anchor store for C2PA signers.

**NOTE**

Previous versions of this specification required the presence of id-kp-emailProtection or idkp-documentSigning EKUs, so including at least one of those two EKUs in a signer's certificate, together with c2pa-kp-claimSigning, can improve compatibility with older validators.

### <span id="page-75-1"></span>**14.4.2. Time Stamping Authorities**

A validator shall maintain a list of X.509 certificate trust anchors for Time Stamping Authorities (TSAs), which shall be separate from the lists [for C2PA signers](#page-74-2). This list shall include, but need not be limited to, the Time Stamping Authority trust anchors provided by the C2PA (i.e., the C2PA TSA Trust List).

**NOTE** This list can be empty.

In addition to the list of trust anchors provided in the C2PA TSA Trust List, a validator should allow a user to configure additional TSA trust anchor stores, and should provide default options or offer lists maintained by external parties that the user may opt into to populate the validator's trust anchor store for Time Stamping Authorities.

### **14.4.3. Private Credential Storage**

A validator may also allow the user to create and maintain a private credential store of signing credentials. This store is intended as an "address book" of credentials they have chosen to trust based on an out-of-band relationship. If present, the private credential store shall only apply to validating signed C2PA manifests, and shall not apply to validating time-stamps. If present, the private credential store shall only allow trust in signer credentials directly; entries in the private credential store cannot issue credentials and shall not be included as trust anchors during validation.

A validator shall not be pre-configured with any entries in a private credential store.

A validator shall only add entries to a private credential store in response to a user request to trust the credential. Similarly, a validator shall only remove entries from a private credential store in response to a user request to stop trusting the credential.

## <span id="page-75-0"></span>**14.5. X.509 Certificates**

X.509 Certificates are stored as defined by [RFC 9360](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9360) (CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE): Header Parameters for Carrying and Referencing X.509 Certificates). For convenience, the definition of x5chain is copied below.

**IMPORTANT** This specification adds additional requirements beyond those of [RFC 9360](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9360), which are listed

after the quoted text. In particular, this specification requires all intermediate certificate authorities' certificates of the signer's certificate chain to be included in the x5chain header, and requires claim generators to always place the x5chain header in the protected header bucket.

x5chain: This header parameter contains an ordered array of X.509 certificates. The certificates are to be ordered starting with the certificate containing the end-entity key followed by the certificate that signed it, and so on. There is no requirement for the entire chain to be present in the element if there is reason to believe that the relying party already has, or can locate, the missing certificates. This means that the relying party is still required to do path building but that a candidate path is proposed in this header parameter.

The trust mechanism MUST process any certificates in this parameter as untrusted input. The presence of a self-signed certificate in the parameter MUST NOT cause the update of the set of trust anchors without some out-of-band confirmation. As the contents of this header parameter are untrusted input, the header parameter can be in either the protected or unprotected header bucket. Sending the header parameter in the unprotected header bucket allows an intermediary to remove or add certificates.

The end-entity certificate MUST be integrity protected by COSE. This can, for example, be done by sending the header parameter in the protected header, sending an 'x5chain' in the unprotected header combined with an 'x5t' in the protected header, or including the end-entity certificate in the external\_aad.

This header parameter allows for a single X.509 certificate or a chain of X.509 certificates to be carried in the message.

- If a single certificate is conveyed, it is placed in a CBOR byte string.
- If multiple certificates are conveyed, a CBOR array of byte strings is used, with each certificate being in its own byte string.

The validator is only expected to have the certificates for its trust anchors. Therefore, when creating the x5chain header as part of signing, the claim generator shall include the signer's certificate and all intermediate certificate authorities in the header's value. The trust anchor's certificate (also called the root certificate) should not be included.

The subjectPublicKeyInfo element of the first or only certificate will be the public key used to validate the signature. The validity element of the tbsCertificate sequence provides the time validity period of the certificate.

A previous version of this specification required claim generators to write the string label x5chain only to avoid the unlikely possibility that the integer label 33 would not be standardized.

Integer label 33 has now been standardized, and this specification now adopts it as standard, and deprecates use of the string label. Therefore:

- Claim generators should use only the integer 33 as the label when inserting this header into a COSE signature. Claim generators may continue to write the string label x5chain but this behaviour is now deprecated and claim generators should be updated to use the integer label only. Claim generators shall place this header only in the protected header bucket of the COSE signature as required above.
- Validators shall accept either the string x5chain or the integer 33 as the label for this header. If both labels are present, validators shall use the header with the integer label 33 and ignore the header with the string x5chain as the label. Validators shall accept the header from either the protected or unprotected bucket, to maintain compatibility with previous versions of this specification. In compliance with [Section 14.2, "Identity of Signers"](#page-72-2), if this header appears in both the protected and unprotected buckets with the same label, a validator shall reject the claim signature as malformed due to the presence of multiple credentials.

## **14.5.1. Certificate Profiles**

#### <span id="page-77-0"></span>**14.5.1.1. General Requirements**

- If the certified public key is used to sign C2PA Claims, time-stamps, or OCSP responses, the cA boolean in the Basic Constraints extension shall not be asserted, and the keyCertSign boolean in the key usage extension shall not be asserted. Only end entity certificates shall be used to sign C2PA Claims, time-stamps, and OCSP responses.
- The Authority Key Identifier extension shall be present in any certificate that is not self-signed, as per [RFC 5280](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280), section 4.2.1.1.
- As prescribed in [RFC 5280,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280) section 4.2.1.2, the Subject Key Identifier extension shall be present in any certificate that acts as a CA. It should be present in end entity certificates.
- As prescribed in [RFC 5280](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280), section 4.2.1.3, the Key Usage extension shall be present and should be marked as critical. Certificates used to sign C2PA manifests shall assert the digitalSignature bit. The keyCertSign bit shall only be asserted if the cA boolean is asserted in the Basic Constraints extension.
- The Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension shall be present and non-empty in any certificate where the Basic Constraints extension is absent or the cA boolean is not asserted, as per [RFC 5280](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280), section 4.2.1.12. These are commonly called "end entity" or "leaf" certificates.
  - The anyExtendedKeyUsage EKU (2.5.29.37.0) shall not be present.
  - A certificate that signs time-stamping countersignatures shall be valid for the id-kp-timeStamping (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.8) purpose.
  - A certificate that signs OCSP responses for certificates shall be valid for the id-kp-OCSPSigning (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9) purpose.
  - If a certificate is valid for either id-kp-timeStamping or id-kp-OCSPSigning, it shall be valid for exactly one of those two purposes, and not valid for any other purpose.
  - A certificate should not be valid for any other purposes outside of the purposes listed above, but the presence of any EKUs not mentioned in this profile and not in the list of EKUs in the configuration store shall not cause the certificate to be rejected.

#### **14.5.1.2. Certificate Trust Chain**

When validating a certificate as the signing credential, if the certificate is present in the private credential store for X.509 certificates, the certificate is accepted. The private credential store is not consulted when validating timestamps.

If the certificate is not present in the private credential store, or the validator does not implement one, the trust chain shall be built and validated according to the procedure in [RFC 5280,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280) section 6 for the particular purpose required (signing, time-stamping, or OCSP signing) and for the appropriate trust anchor store for that purpose. Any failure of that validation algorithm shall mean the chain shall be rejected. The private credential store is never included when building certificate chains; certificates in the private credential store cannot act as CAs.

A validator shall ensure a signing certificate is authorized for the purpose for which it is being used, and reject certificates used for an unauthorized purpose. A certificate is authorized for a particular purpose if the purpose's EKU Object Identifier (OID) is present in the Extended Key Usage extension of the certificate ([RFC 5280,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280) section 4.2.1.12).

When validating a certificate used to sign a C2PA Claim, the signing certificate shall have at least one of the EKUs for which the validator has an associated list of trust anchors (see [Section 14.4.1, "C2PA Signers"](#page-74-2)), and the validator shall use only the trust anchors it associates with EKUs present in the certificate.

Except for certificates accepted through the private credential store for X.509 certificates, a validator shall verify a certificate's compliance with the Certificate Profile, and reject certificates that do not comply. This includes requiring the presence of the Extended Key Usage extension, as well as a certificate being authorized for no more than one of the three purposes listed in this section: C2PA signing, time-stamp signing, or OCSP response signing.

As described in the Certificate Profile, Certification Authority (CA) certificates are not required to have an EKU extension, and usually will not. If one is present, then the validator shall ignore it.

## <span id="page-80-1"></span>**14.5.2. Certificate Revocation**

X.509 certificates support revocation status queries. A claim generator should use the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP, [RFC 6960\)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960) and OCSP stapling (as originally conceptualized in [RFC 6066, Section 8](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6066), but implemented as described in this clause) to implement revocation. The claim generator shall not use Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs, [RFC 5280\)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280). ``

**NOTE**

Using CRLs requires downloading the entire list of revoked certificates for each Certificate Authority encountered, which can be time-consuming. Although a CRL could be included in the same way an OCSP response is stapled, the potential size of a CRL relative to an OCSP response also makes this undesirable.

A conforming CA should include an AuthorityInfoAccess (AIA) extension [\(RFC 5280,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280) section 4.2.2.1) in their issued certificates to provide access information for the OCSP service operated by the CA.

If the certificate has an AIA extension, revocation information shall be stored in an unprotected header of the COSE\_Sign1 structure with the string label rVals and the value's schema shall follow the rVals rule in [Example 3,](#page-80-0) ["CDDL for](#page-80-0) [rVals](#page-80-0)["](#page-80-0):

<span id="page-80-0"></span>Example 3. CDDL for rVals

```
; CBOR version of rVals and related structures based on JSON schema in
https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119100_119199/11918201/01.01.01_60/ts_11918201v010
101p.pdf section 5.3.5.2
rVals = {
  "ocspVals": [1* bstr] 
}
```

**NOTE** The above definition is a CBOR adaptation of a subset of the schema from [JAdES](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119100_119199/11918201/01.01.01_60/ts_11918201v010101p.pdf), section 5.3.5.2,

which only stores OCSP responses, and stores them as binary strings.

Before signing a claim, if a signer's certificate has the AIA extension, a claim generator should query the OCSP service indicated therein, capture the response, and store it in an element of the ocspVals array of the rVals header. The claim generator should do the same for any intermediate CA certificates it includes with the claim signature.

Upon receipt of the claim, stapled OCSP responses shall be validated according to section 3.2 of [RFC 6960](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960).

The process for validating the revocation status of a certificate after a claim has been signed is described in more detail in [Validate the Credential Revocation Information](#page-102-0).

# <span id="page-82-0"></span>**Chapter 15. Validation**

## <span id="page-82-1"></span>**15.1. Validation Process**

## **15.1.1. Description**

Validation of a C2PA Manifest is a multi-step process that involves validating the assertions, claim & associated claim signature contained within it along with (for active manifests, only) validation of any associated hard bindings. This validation process is performed by a validator, which is a hardware or software actor that implements the validation algorithms described in this clause.

## **15.1.2. Phases of Validation**

These phases, which are listed in no particular order, are described in the following clauses:

- [Section 15.10, "Validate the Assertions"](#page-104-0): Validation of the assertions.
- [Section 15.11, "Validate the Ingredients"](#page-112-0): Validation of the ingredients, if any.
- [Section 15.8, "Validate the Time-Stamp"](#page-99-0): Validation of the time-stamp.
- [Section 15.9, "Validate the Credential Revocation Information":](#page-102-0) Validation of the credential revocation information.
- [Section 15.7, "Validate the Signature":](#page-98-1) Validation of the claim signature.
- [Section 15.12, "Validate the Asset's Content"](#page-118-0): Validation of the content of the asset.

As described in [Section 14.3, "Validation states",](#page-73-0) a C2PA Manifest may be considered as [Well-Formed](#page-73-1), [Valid](#page-73-2) or [Trusted](#page-74-1) based on the results of these steps.

## **15.1.3. Visual Representation**

[Figure 13, "Validating a Claim"](#page-83-1) is a visual representation of the process of validating a C2PA Manifest.

<span id="page-83-1"></span>![](_page_83_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 13. Validating a Claim

**NOTE**

If there are any discrepancies between the visual representation and the text, the text is considered authoritative.

## <span id="page-83-0"></span>**15.2. Returning Validation Results**

## **15.2.1. General**

The validation algorithm shall return a consolidated set of validation results for the all manifests in the asset's C2PA Manifest Store, including the active manifest as well all other manifests in the C2PA Manifest Store that are referenced via ingredient assertions.

Validation results are expressed via a standard set of success, informational, and failure codes, as defined below in [Section 15.2.2, "Standard Status Codes".](#page-86-0) Custom status codes are also permitted, when a claim generator has a need to record some process-specific status information. Custom codes shall conform to the same syntax as [entity-specific](#page-29-4) [namespaces](#page-29-4), e.g. com.litware.

When a claim generator adds an ingredient asset via an ingredient assertion, it shall act as a validator, and perform the full validation algorithm described in this section on the ingredient. The claim generator shall record the validation results of the ingredient, per the following [CDDL Definition](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610) schema, as the value of the validationResults field in the [ingredient assertion.](#page-209-0)

The validation results may also contain a SemVer formatted specVersion field which represents the version of this specification that was used as the basis for the validation procedure. It may also contain a trustListURI field, which is a URI that identifies the trust list that was used to [validate the claim signature](#page-98-1).

## <span id="page-94-0"></span>**15.3. Displaying Manifest Information**

Manifest Consumers should not display data from manifests which are not [Valid](#page-73-2) nor from assets which are not [Valid](#page-73-3). If the Manifest Consumer chooses to display such data, it shall include as part of the display:

- a warning about the lack of validity,
- a warning that the data shall not be attributed to the manifest's signer, and in the case of an ingredient manifest, additional not to the asset's manifest's signer.

**NOTE**

In authoring scenarios, it is desirable to more prominently raise warnings so that a creator can make an informed decision about how to proceed with an asset that is not Valid or that has a flawed provenance history .

## <span id="page-94-1"></span>**15.4. Determining the hashing algorithm**

## **15.4.1. For hard binding assertions**

Each hard binding assertion has an alg field that specifies the hashing algorithm used to compute the hash of the asset. If the alg field is present, it shall be used as the hashing algorithm for the hard binding assertion. If no alg field is present in the hard binding assertion, the value of the alg field in the Claim shall be used as the hash algorithm. If no alg field is present in the Claim, the Claim shall be rejected with a failure code of algorithm.unsupported.

### **15.4.2. For Hashed URIs**

Various parts of the C2PA Manifest utilize a hashed\_uri structure for encapsulating a URI, its hash and (optionally) the algorithm used to compute the hash. If there is an alg field in the hashed\_uri structure, it shall be used as the hashing algorithm. If the alg field is not present in the hashed\_uri structure, the hash algorithm shall be determined by evaluating the nearest enclosing structure that contains an alg field. If no alg field is found in any of these locations, the value of the alg field in the claim shall be used as the hash algorithm. If no alg field is present in any of these locations, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of algorithm.unsupported.

## <span id="page-95-1"></span>**15.4.3. For Hashed Ext URIs**

Some parts of a C2PA Manifest utilize a hashed\_ext\_uri structure for encapsulating an external URI, its hash and the algorithm used to compute the hash. If there is an alg field in the hashed\_ext\_uri structure, it shall be used as the hashing algorithm. If the alg field is not present in the hashed\_ext\_uri structure, the failure code of algorithm.unsupported shall be used.

**NOTE**

The alg field is mandatory in hashed\_ext\_uri, so no recursive procedure to determine the hash algorithm is necessary.

## <span id="page-95-2"></span>**15.4.4. Algorithm validation**

Once the hashing algorithm is determined, it shall be compared to the values in the allowed list or the deprecated list in [Section 13.1, "Hashing".](#page-67-1) If it is not present in either list, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of algorithm.unsupported. If the algorithm is present in the deprecated list, the claim shall be issued an informational code of algorithm.deprecated.

## <span id="page-95-0"></span>**15.5. Locating the Active Manifest**

## **15.5.1. General**

The last C2PA Manifest superbox in the C2PA Manifest Store superbox shall be considered the active manifest, but locating the C2PA Manifest Store may involve looking in a number of possible locations.

## **15.5.2. Embedded**

The C2PA Manifest Store shall be located by the validator embedded inside the asset at the [standard locations for](#page-64-0) [embedding manifests](#page-64-0). However, if an asset was retrieved via an HTTP connection, a validator may look for a Link header, as described in the [Link Header](#page-97-0) clause below, to determine if a C2PA Manifest Store is present.

**NOTE**

Checking the Link header, if present, allows a validator to determine if a C2PA Manifest Store is present without having to download the entire asset. This is useful for assets that are large or that are streamed.

If there are multiple C2PA Manifest Stores present in an asset, they shall all be considered as invalid and the validation should treat this as if no manifests were located. In the case where this asset is being added as an ingredient, none of these embedded C2PA Manifests shall be included in the ingredient assertion.

### **15.5.2.2. Special Considerations for PDF**

PDF files support a technology called "incremental update", where information is appended to the end of the document instead of modifying the original. This requires that PDF files support multiple C2PA Manifest Stores though there shall only be one per update section.

If there are multiple C2PA Manifest Stores present in a single update section, they shall all be considered as invalid and the validation should treat this as if no manifests were located. However, any C2PA Manifest Stores present in early updates of the PDF or of the original PDF, shall still be considered valid and processed accordingly.

#### **15.5.2.3. Special Considerations for Unstructured Text**

For assets consisting of unstructured text, the C2PA Manifest Store shall be located by following the procedure defined in [Section A.7, "Embedding Manifests into Unstructured Text".](#page-268-0)

### <span id="page-96-0"></span>**15.5.3. By Reference or URI**

#### **15.5.3.1. By Reference**

If there is no embedded C2PA Manifest Store, the following attempts should be made to locate one at a remote location.

- If the asset was retrieved via an HTTP connection, the [Link Header](#page-97-0) clause below describes how to find a manifest via the Link header.
- If the asset has any XMP in the standard asset locations (i.e., outside the C2PA Manifest) and that XMP contains a dcterms:provenance key, the provided URI should be used to locate the active manifest.
- If the asset is a font with a C2PA table and its activeManifestUriLength is non-zero, then the indicated URI should be used to locate the active manifest.
- If no C2PA Manifest Store has been located, the validator should look for files at the same path or URI, but with a filename extension of .c2pa. If the C2PA Manifest Store is not found, a validator may look in whatever additional places it deems most appropriate to locate it. For example, a child folder of a file system.

**NOTE**

A validator is not restricted to only the above locations, it can choose to look in additional locations as well.

If a manifest was documented to exist in a remote location, but is not present there, or the location is not currently available (such as in an offline scenario), the manifest.inaccessible error code shall be used to report the situation.

Information about the IANA media type for a C2PA Manifest Store can be found in the [external manifests section](#page-64-1).

### <span id="page-97-0"></span>**15.5.3.2. By Link header**

If the asset was retrieved via an HTTP connection, the validator should look in the header of the HTTP response for a Link header, as defined in [RFC 8288](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8288), containing a parameter of rel=c2pa-manifest. If present, a C2PA Manifest Store can be retrieved from that URI reference. The URI will be a standard http or https URI, such as https://c2pa.org/image.c2pa.

It is also possible to use the link relation to refer to the C2PA Manifest Store that is embedded inside an asset through the use of a [JUMBF URI](#page-37-0) fragment. The URI would include a [JUMBF URI](#page-37-0) fragment, to the C2PA Manifest Store superbox https://c2pa.org/image.jpg#jumbf=c2pa. References to specific C2PA Manifests within the C2PA Manifest Store are not permitted and the validator shall ignore any childlabel portion of the [JUMBF URI](#page-37-0) fragment.

**NOTE** HTTP refers to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol defined in [RFC 7230](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230), not the specific URL scheme http://.

### **15.5.4. Decompression**

As described [previously,](#page-64-2) both standard and update manifests can be compressed. When a compressed manifest is encountered, a validator shall decompress it before proceeding with the standard validation process. If the data contained in the brob box of a compressed manifest is not either a standard or update manifest or if the decompression fails, the validator shall reject the manifest with a failure code of manifest.compressed.invalid.

## **15.5.5. Validating a Match**

A validator may wish to validate that the located C2PA Manifest Store is indeed the one associated with asset.

If the C2PA Manifest Store was located then the hard binding assertion present in its active manifest shall be used to validate that it is the matching manifest and whether the asset has been modified without manifest updates. If the hard binding does not match, it is unknown if that is because of (a) modification of the asset or (b) the wrong C2PA Manifest Store was located. Accordingly, the validator shall treat this as a non-matching hard binding and reject the manifest with a failure code of assertion.dataHash.mismatch if a data hash assertion is used, assertion.boxesHash.mismatch if a general box hash assertion is used, assertion.collectionHash.mismatch if a collection data hash assertion is used, or assertion.bmffHash.mismatch if a BMFF hash assertion is used.

## <span id="page-98-0"></span>**15.6. Locating and Validating the Claim**

## **15.6.1. Locating**

Once the manifest to be validated has been located (hereafter referred to as the "current manifest"), the claim is found by locating, within the current manifest, the JUMBF Superbox with a label of c2pa.claim.v2 (or c2pa.claim for files with older claim structures) and a JUMBF type UUID of 6332636C-0011-0010-8000- 00AA00389B71 (c2cl). Note that the JUMBF type UUID is the same for both the new (with c2pa.claim.v2 label) and old (with c2pa.claim label) claim formats. There shall only be one such box in the current manifest. If more than one is located, the C2PA Manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of claim.multiple.

## **15.6.2. Validating**

If the content of the claim is not well-formed CBOR, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of claim.cbor.invalid.

**NOTE** Well-formed CBOR is defined in [RFC 8949,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949) Appendix C.

For a "c2pa.claim.v2", the following fields are expected to be present in the CBOR object. If any are absent, then the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of claim.malformed.

- instanceID
- signature
- created\_assertions
- claim\_generator\_info

If the claim\_generator\_info field does not contain a name field, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of claim.malformed.

If there is an icon field in the generator-info-map referenced by the claim\_generator\_info field of the claim-map or claim-map-v2, then its value shall be validated as described in [Section 15.10.3.3, "Validation of](#page-111-0) [References"](#page-111-0).

## <span id="page-98-1"></span>**15.7. Validate the Signature**

The validator shall retrieve the URI reference for the signature from the value of the claim's signature field and resolve the URI reference to obtain the COSE signature. If the signature field is not present, or the URI cannot be resolved, or the URI does not resolve to a location within the same C2PA Manifest box (as the claim), then the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of claimSignature.missing.

For all types of C2PA Manifests, the validation of the credential used in the signature shall be performed according to [Chapter 14,](#page-72-0) [Trust Model](#page-72-0).

If the credential is not acceptable per [the requirements of the credential's type](#page-75-0), then the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of signingCredential.invalid. If the signature algorithm is not on the allowed or deprecated list in [Section 13.2, "Digital Signatures",](#page-68-0) then the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of algorithm.unsupported.

Before a chain of trust to a trust anchor is established, the validator shall first determine if a [valid time-stamp](#page-99-0) is present. Then, a chain of trust should be verified from the credential to a trust anchor configuration in one of the applicable trust anchor lists. If a "notBefore" date/time is present in a trust anchor configuration, that configuration shall not validate claim signatures whose timestamp (or current time, if no timestamp is present) is before that date/time. If a "notAfter" date/time is present, that configuration shall not validate claim signatures whose timestamp (or current time, if no timestamp is present) is after that date/time.

If a chain of trust cannot be verified, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of signingCredential.untrusted; otherwise, the claim signature shall be assigned a success code of signingCredential.trusted.

If the claim has not yet been rejected, validation shall proceed according to the specified procedure in [Section 13.2,](#page-68-0) ["Digital Signatures"](#page-68-0). If validation of the signature fails, then the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of claimSignature.mismatch. Otherwise, the claim signature shall be assigned a success code of claimSignature.validated.

For the remainder of this chapter, headers refer to the union of the set of protected and unprotected header parameters in the COSE signature. Unless otherwise specified in [Section 13.2, "Digital Signatures"](#page-68-0) or [Section 14.5,](#page-75-0) ["X.509 Certificates",](#page-75-0) a header may appear in either bucket. COSE headers are described in [RFC 8152](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152), section 3.

## <span id="page-99-0"></span>**15.8. Validate the Time-Stamp**

## **15.8.1. Obtaining the TimeStampToken**

#### **15.8.1.1. Embedded in the Claim Signature**

If either the sigTst or sigTst2 header is present, then the tstTokens array is expected to contain a single tstToken. If the header contains more than one tstToken, the validator shall issue a timestamp.malformed informational code and ignore the time-stamps.

A validator that supports sigTst shall perform the following procedures to validate the time-stamp response:

- Retrieve the val property from the tstToken, which shall be an RFC3161-compliant TimeStampResp (timestamp response).
- Check the value of the status field PKIStatusInfo, which is the value of the status field of TimeStampResp.
  - If it contains any value other than 0 (granted) or 1 (grantedWithMods), the validator shall issue a timeStamp.malformed informational code and ignore that time-stamp.

- If it is either 0 (granted) or 1 (grantedWithMods), continue with the rest of the time-stamp validation process as described below.
- Retrieve the value of the timeStampToken field of the TimeStampResp for use in the remainder of the validation process.

A validator for sigTst2 shall retrieve the val property from the tstToken, which shall be an RFC3161-compliant timeStampToken (TimeStampToken, TST).

#### **15.8.1.2. Referenced by a time-stamp assertion**

If a validator has already located a TimeStampToken in a sigTst or sigTst2 header, that passes validation (as per [Section 15.8.2, "Validating the TimeStampToken"\)](#page-100-0), then it shall skip this step. When no such header exists or the TimeStampToken located there did not pass validation, this step shall be followed.

If a validator had previously located any [time-stamp assertions,](#page-224-0) which were then maintained in a mapping of C2PA Manifest identifiers to TimeStampTokens, then the validator shall check if the current C2PA Manifest's identifier is present in the mapping. If it is, the validator shall use the TimeStampToken associated with the identifier in the mapping for the TimeStampToken in the validation process described in [Section 15.8.2, "Validating the](#page-100-0) [TimeStampToken"](#page-100-0). If more than one TimeStampToken for that identifier is found in the mapping, the validator shall try each one until one successfully passes validation (and then should ignore the others). If the identifier does not appear in the mapping, no error is raised, as it simply means that there is no TimeStampToken associated with this C2PA Manifest in the current context.

## <span id="page-100-0"></span>**15.8.2. Validating the TimeStampToken**

All validators shall continue the process as follows:

- If the signature algorithm in the timeStampToken is not on the allowed or deprecated list in [Section 13.2,](#page-68-0) ["Digital Signatures"](#page-68-0), then the validator shall issue a timestamp.untrusted informational code and ignore the time-stamp.
- Validate the signature in the timeStampToken, as described in [RFC 2630,](http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2630) Section 5.6. If the signature is not valid, then the validator shall issue a timestamp.mismatch informational code and ignore the time-stamp.
- If the timeStampToken does not contain a messageImprint field, the validator shall issue a timestamp.malformed informational code and ignore the time-stamp.
- If the message imprint hash algorithm is not on the allowed or deprecated list in [Section 13.1, "Hashing"](#page-67-1), then the validator shall issue a timestamp.untrusted informational code and ignore the time-stamp.
- Validate that the value of the messageImprint field (in the timeStampToken), matches either the claim (v1, sigTst) or COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged structure's signature field (v2, sigTst2) of the C2PA Manifest being validated, as described in [Section 10.3.2.5.2, "Choosing the Payload"](#page-49-0). If the values do not match, the validator shall issue a timestamp.mismatch informational code and ignore the time-stamp.
- Validate that the certificates field of the timeStampToken is present, the TSA's certificate can be found in the provided set of certificates in this field, and it is possible to build a trust chain from the TSA's certificate to an

entry in C2PA TSA Trust List (or other list of trust anchors present in the validator for this purpose). If the certificate cannot be located or a trust chain cannot be constructed, the validator shall issue a timestamp.untrusted informational code and ignore the time-stamp. If the validator determines that a certificate is invalid it may additionally return the informational code timeStamp.credentialInvalid.

- Validate that the attested time, as found in the genTime field (in the timeStampToken), falls within the validity period of the TSA's signing certificate and all CA certificates up to the trust anchor. If it does not, the validator shall issue a timestamp.outsideValidity informational code and ignore the time-stamp.
- If the time-stamp validation does not stop or fail due to any of the above conditions, then the validator shall issue the success codes of timeStamp.trusted and timeStamp.validated.
- If the validator issued both timeStamp.trusted and timeStamp.validated success codes, then the validator shall validate that the time attested by the Time Stamping Authority (TSA), as found in the genTime field (in the timeStampToken), falls within the validity period of the claim signing certificate and all CA certificates up to the trust anchor. If it does not, the validator shall reject the claim with a claimSignature.outsideValidity failure code.

**NOTE**

Time-stamps remain valid even after the signing credential of the time-stamp authority expires, so long as the attested time falls within the time-stamp authority's certificate's validity period. This is a special type of trust extended only to time-stamp authorities.

At time of validation, when a time-stamp is present, trusted, and validated, validators shall use the attested time, and not the current time, when determining the time validity of the signing certificate and the time-stamp authority's certificate.

**NOTE**

This document does not require that the revocation status of a Time Stamping Authority's certificate be captured at signing time nor validated at validation time.

If neither the sigTst nor the sigTst2 headers are present, or if at least one of them is present but their time-stamp token does not satisfy the above requirements, then the C2PA Manifest is valid if the current time at validation is within the validity period of the signer's certificate and all CA certificates up to the trust anchor. If it is, the validator shall return a success code of claimSignature.insideValidity. If it is not, the C2PA Manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of claimSignature.outsideValidity.

## **15.8.3. Validating the "claimed time of signing"**

A validator may choose to validate the "claimed time of signing" as attested by the value present in the iat protected header. If the iat header is present, the validator may validate that the attested time falls within the validity period of the signer's certificate and all CA certificates up to the trust anchor, and not later than the time attested by any associated trusted time-stamp. If the validator does the validation of this value, and it falls inside the validity period, the validator shall return the timeOfSigning.insideValidity informational code, but if it falls outside the validity period, then the validator shall return the timeOfSigning.outsideValidity informational code.

## <span id="page-102-0"></span>**15.9. Validate the Credential Revocation Information**

The validator shall attempt to discover the revocation status of the signer's certificate and all CA certificates that are part of the trust chain.

For CA certificates, the validator should determine revocation status as indicated in the Authority Information Access (AIA) extension as described in [RFC 5280,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280) section 4.2.2.1. The validator should make use of relevant OCSP responses included in the C2PA Manifest if the AIA extension indicates that OCSP is available.

If the validator determines that a CA certificate was revoked at the time indicated in a trusted time-stamp, or at the current time if no trusted time-stamp is present, then the claim signature shall be rejected with a failure status of signingCredential.untrusted.

For the signer's certificate, the validator shall use the following process.

- If a certificate does not support revocation status, or the certificate issuer did not provide a method to query its revocation status, the validator shall treat the credential as not revoked.
- If the claim generator "stapled" OCSP responses in the rVals header of the COSE\_Sign1 structure, the validator shall decode and validate the stapled OCSP responses as described in [Section 15.9.1, "Determining](#page-102-1) [revocation through OCSP responses in the C2PA Manifest Store".](#page-102-1)
- If subsequent claim generators added [certificate status assertions](#page-225-0) in other C2PA Manifests in the C2PA Manifest Store, the validator shall use those OCSP response(s) in the validation process described in [Section 15.9.1,](#page-102-1) ["Determining revocation through OCSP responses in the C2PA Manifest Store".](#page-102-1) If more than one OCSP response for the certificate is found, the validator shall try each one until one successfully passes validation (and then should ignore the others).

If no revocation information was found in the C2PA Manifest Store, and the validator is online, and the validator desires to verify the revocation status for the certificate, then the validator shall attempt to determine the revocation status of the certificate by querying the OCSP responder as described in [Section 15.9.2, "Determining revocation from](#page-103-0) [online OCSP response"](#page-103-0).

## <span id="page-102-1"></span>**15.9.1. Determining revocation through OCSP responses in the C2PA Manifest Store**

A validator shall decode OCSP responses per the requirements of [RFC 6960](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960), in particular requirements 1 through 4 of section 3.2. If an OCSP response is accepted, and if all of the following requirements are met, then this establishes that the relevant certificate was not revoked at the time of signing.

- The claim signature has an attested time provided by a valid signed time-stamp.
- There exists a SingleResponse in the responses array of the tbsResponseData field of the OCSP response such that all of the following conditions hold:
  - The current time is no earlier than thisUpdate.
  - The attested time from the time-stamp:

- is earlier than thisUpdate, or
- falls within the (thisUpdate,nextUpdate) interval, if nextUpdate is present, or
- falls within the (thisUpdate,producedAt + 24 hours) interval where producedAt is the field in the containing ResponseData, if nextUpdate is not present.
- The certStatus field of the SingleResponse is good.
- The OCSP signer of the response is an "authorized responder" as defined by [RFC 6960,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960) section 4.2.2.2.

Validators shall check the revocationReason of any revoked response to disambiguate the removedFromCRL case from an actual revocation.

If the above conditions are met for any OCSP response in the C2PA Manifest Store, then the validator shall either issue a signingCredential.ocsp.notRevoked success code, indicating that the certificate is considered not revoked at the time of signing, or (for additional assurance) perform an online OCSP check as described in [Section](#page-103-0) [15.9.2, "Determining revocation from online OCSP response".](#page-103-0)

Otherwise, if an OCSP response in the C2PA Manifest Store meets all of the above conditions except that the certStatus field is revoked, the certificate shall be considered revoked and the claim shall be rejected with a signingCredential.ocsp.revoked failure code.

### <span id="page-103-0"></span>**15.9.2. Determining revocation from online OCSP response**

If, for a given certificate, no OCSP response in the C2PA Manifest Store satisfies the conditions in [Section 15.9.1,](#page-102-1) ["Determining revocation through OCSP responses in the C2PA Manifest Store",](#page-102-1) or if the claim signature does not have a time-stamp, the validator may choose to query the OCSP responder, per [RFC 6960,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960) with the responder accessLocation found via [RFC 6960,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960) section 3.1.

## **NOTE**

Querying the credential status method can reveal to an observer the identity of the asset being validated, and so this query is optional.

If the validator chooses not to perform an online OCSP check, it shall issue a signingCredential.ocsp.skipped informational code.

If the validator attempts to query the OCSP responder but is unable to receive a response, the validator shall issue a signingCredential.ocsp.inaccessible informational code.

If a response is received and accepted per the requirements 1 - 4 of [RFC 6960](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960), section 3.2, it shall establish the signer's certificate was not revoked at the time of signing if either of the following requirements is fulfilled:

- The claim signature has a valid time-stamp, and the attested time falls within the (thisUpdate,nextUpdate) interval of the response, or
- The claim signature does not have a valid time-stamp but the current real-world time falls within the (thisUpdate,nextUpdate) interval of the response,

And both of the following requirements are fulfilled:

- The certStatus field of the response is good, or revoked but with a revocationReason of removeFromCRL, and
- The OCSP signer of the response is an "authorized responder" as defined by [RFC 6960,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960) section 4.2.2.2.

If the certStatus field of the response is revoked but with a revocationReason that is not removeFromCRL, it shall establish the signer's certificate was not revoked at the time of signing if both of the following requirements are met:

- The manifest has a valid time-stamp, and the attested time falls within the (thisUpdate,nextUpdate) interval of the response, and
- The revocationTime in the response is after the attested time-stamp.

If the above conditions are met, the certificate shall be considered not revoked at the time of signing, and the validator shall issue a signingCredential.ocsp.notRevoked success code.

#### Otherwise:

- If the certStatus field of the response is unknown, a signingCredential.ocsp.unknown informational code shall be recorded.
- Else, the certificate shall be considered revoked and the claim shall be rejected with a signingCredential.ocsp.revoked failure code.

## <span id="page-104-0"></span>**15.10. Validate the Assertions**

## <span id="page-104-1"></span>**15.10.1. Validate the correct assertions for the type of manifest**

#### **15.10.1.1. General**

Depending on the [type of manifest,](#page-62-0) there are assertions that are either required or forbidden. A validator shall check for required and not-permitted assertions.

#### **15.10.1.2. Standard Manifest Assertions**

If it is a [standard manifest](#page-62-1):

- 1. Validate that there is exactly one [hard binding to content](#page-41-0) assertion either a c2pa.hash.data, a c2pa.hash.boxes, a c2pa.hash.collection.data, c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 (deprecated), or a c2pa.hash.bmff.v3. If no such assertion is present, the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of claim.hardBindings.missing. If there is more than one such assertion, the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.multipleHardBindings.
- 2. Validate that there are zero or one c2pa.ingredient assertions whose relationship is parentOf. If

there is more than one, the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of manifest.multipleParents.

3. Validate that either a c2pa.created or c2pa.opened action is contained in exactly one actions assertion.

#### **15.10.1.3. Update Manifest Assertions**

If it is an [update manifest:](#page-63-0)

- 1. Validate that exactly one ingredient assertion is present and that its relationship is parentOf. If there is not (i.e., either it is missing, there are more than one, or the value of relationship is not parentOf), the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of manifest.update.wrongParents.
- 2. Validate that there are no c2pa.hash.data, c2pa.hash.boxes, c2pa.hash.collection.data, c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 (deprecated), c2pa.hash.bmff.v3, or [thumbnail](#page-190-0) assertions. If there are, the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of manifest.update.invalid.
- 3. Validate that there are no c2pa.hash.multi-asset assertions. If there are, the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of manifest.update.invalid.
- 4. If there is one or more c2pa.actions or c2pa.actions.v2 assertions, validate that the action field of each action found in the actions array of any such assertion is one of the supported values specified in [Update](#page-63-0) [Manifests](#page-63-0). If it is not, the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of manifest.update.invalid.

## <span id="page-105-1"></span>**15.10.2. Preparing the list of redacted assertions**

A validator, when processing a claim, shall gather the set of redacted assertions for each ingredient's manifest (if present) based on each JUMBF URI listed in its redacted\_assertions field. A claim's redacted\_assertions field shall never include a JUMBF URI to any of its own assertions.

**NOTE**

Assertions can be redacted from ingredient assets at any point in the final asset's provenance history, and not necessarily by the claim generator that first uses an ingredient asset as an ingredient.

For more details, refer to the [Section 15.11.3.2, "Performing explicit validation"](#page-115-0) section.

## <span id="page-105-0"></span>**15.10.3. Assertion Validation**

#### **15.10.3.1. General**

Each assertion in the created\_assertions and gathered\_assertions fields of the claim (and in the assertions field of a v1 claim) is a hashed\_uri structure. For each assertion, the validator shall first determine if the URI reference in the url field is in the [list of redacted assertions](#page-105-1).

**NOTE**

Even though the assertions listed in the gathered\_assertions field were not created by the claim generator, they are still part of the Claim and are therefore also validated according to this validation algorithm.

If it is in the list of redacted assertions, then if the assertion's label is c2pa.actions or c2pa.actions.v2, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.redacted as c2pa.actions and c2pa.actions.v2 assertions shall not be redacted. If it is in the list of redacted assertions, then if the assertion's label is a [hard binding to content](#page-41-0) assertion - either a c2pa.hash.data, c2pa.hash.boxes, c2pa.hash.collection.data, c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 (deprecated), or c2pa.hash.bmff.v3 - the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.hardBinding.redacted as these types of assertions shall not be redacted. Otherwise, the redacted assertion is considered valid, and validation continues [based on the type of](#page-106-0) [assertion.](#page-106-0)

For all other assertions (not found in the list of redacted assertions), resolve the URI reference in the url field to obtain its data. If the URI does not refer to a location within the same C2PA Manifest (a self#jumbf location), the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.outsideManifest. If the URI cannot be resolved and the data retrieved, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.missing.

Follow the procedure in [Section 15.4, "Determining the hashing algorithm"](#page-94-1) to determine the hash algorithm and any possible failure codes. Compute the hash of the assertion using that algorithm and the procedure described in [Section 8.4.2.3, "Hashing JUMBF Boxes"](#page-39-0), and compare the computed hash value with the value in the hash field. If they do not match, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.hashedURI.mismatch. Otherwise, a success code of assertion.hashedURI.match shall be recorded.

If the content of a standard assertion is not well-formed CBOR or is non-conforming JSON, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.cbor.invalid or assertion.json.invalid.

**NOTE** Well-formed CBOR is defined in [RFC 8949,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949) Appendix C.

**NOTE** [RFC 8259](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259), Clause 2, defines the grammar that JSON data conforms to.

If an assertion that is present in the assertion store is not referenced by an element of either the created\_assertions or gathered\_assertions arrays in the claim (or the assertions array in the v1 claim), the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.undeclared.

For each URI in the claim's redacted\_assertions array, if the URI points into the claim's own manifest, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.selfRedacted. A claim is not permitted to redact its own assertions.

#### <span id="page-106-0"></span>**15.10.3.2. Specific Assertion Validation**

For each assertion, the validator shall check the assertion's label and if it is listed below, the validator shall perform the specific validation steps for that assertion type. If the assertion's label is not listed below, then that type of assertion does not require any additional validation steps beyond those already described.

**NOTE** Ingredient assertions (c2pa.ingredient or c2pa.ingredient.v2 or c2pa.ingredient.v3) are subject to additional validation at a different point in the validation process (see [Section 15.11, "Validate the Ingredients"](#page-112-0)).

If the value of any field of a standard assertion is a hashed\_uri or hashed\_ext\_uri, the validator shall perform the steps described in [Section 15.10.3.3, "Validation of References",](#page-111-0) except for the activeManifest field in c2pa.ingredient.v3, for which special validation behavior is specified in [Section 15.11.3, "Ingredient Assertion](#page-113-0) [Validation"](#page-113-0).

#### <span id="page-107-0"></span>**15.10.3.2.1. c2pa.cloud-data validation**

If the assertion's label is c2pa.cloud-data:

- 1. Check that the assertion contains the following fields: label, size, location and content\_type. If any of those fields are missing, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.clouddata.malformed.
- 2. If the label field of the external assertion is any of the following values, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.cloud-data.hardBinding.

- 4. The location field shall be validated according to [Section 15.10.4.2, "Validation of External References".](#page-112-1)
- 5. If the data for the external assertion is retrieved (from the specified location), the label of the JUMBF box retrieved from that location shall match the value of the label field in the c2pa.cloud-data assertion. If it does not, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.cloud-data.labelMismatch.

#### <span id="page-108-0"></span>**15.10.3.2.2. c2pa.external-reference validation**

If the assertion's label is c2pa.external-reference:

- 1. Check that the assertion contains the following fields: label, location and within location the fields uri and content\_type. If any of those fields are missing, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.external-reference.malformed.

- 3. If the manifest is an update manifest and the label field of the external assertion is c2pa.actions or c2pa.actions.v2, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.externalreference.actions.
- 4. If the assertion is present within the list of created assertions then the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.external-reference.created.

#### <span id="page-108-1"></span>**15.10.3.2.3. c2pa.actions validation**

If the assertion's label is c2pa.actions or c2pa.actions.v2:

- 1. Ensure that it has an actions field. If not, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.malformed.
- 2. For each action in the actions list:
  - a. If the action field is either c2pa.created or c2pa.opened, then the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.malformed unless all of the following are true:
    - i. the assertion is the first actions assertion in the created\_assertions or gathered\_assertions array (of a v2 claim), or the first actions assertion in the assertions array of a v1 claim, and
    - ii. the action is the first element in the actions array in this assertion.
  - b. If the action field is c2pa.opened, c2pa.placed, or c2pa.removed:
    - i. If the action has no parameters field, or that field's value is empty, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.ingredientMismatch.
    - ii. If the action's parameters field contains no ingredients field (or ingredient field for c2pa.actions), the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.ingredientMismatch.
    - iii. If the value of the ingredients field is not an array with at least one element, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.ingredientMismatch.
    - iv. Check references to ingredient assertions:
      - A. For c2pa.opened: Check that the ingredients field (or ingredient field for c2pa.actions) contains exactly one valid hashed URI that can be resolved to an ingredient

- assertion in the current manifest whose relationship field is parentOf. If not, then the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.ingredientMismatch.
- B. For c2pa.placed: Check that the ingredients field (or ingredient field for c2pa.actions) contains one or more valid hashed URIs, each of which can be resolved to an ingredient assertion in the current manifest whose relationship field is componentOf. If not, then the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.ingredientMismatch.
- C. For c2pa.removed: Check that the ingredients field (or ingredient field for c2pa.actions) contains one or more valid hashed URIs, each of which can be resolved to an ingredient assertion in another manifest whose relationship field is componentOf. If not, then the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.ingredientMismatch.
- c. If the action field is c2pa.transcoded or c2pa.repackaged:
  - i. If the ingredients field (or ingredient field for c2pa.actions) is present, check that each element of that field is a valid hashed URI that can be resolved to an ingredient assertion in the current manifest with relationship parentOf. If not, then the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.ingredientMismatch.
- d. If the action field is c2pa.redacted:
  - i. Check the redacted field that is a member of the parameters object for the presence of a JUMBF URI. If the JUMBF URI is not present, or cannot be resolved to an assertion, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.redactionMismatch.
- e. If there is a softwareAgent field in the action-common-map-v2 or one or more softwareAgents listed in the softwareAgents field of the actions-map-v2:
  - i. If there is an icon field in the generator-info-map, then it shall be validated as described in [Section](#page-111-0) [15.10.3.3, "Validation of References"](#page-111-0).

  - i. Verify that there is also a [c2pa.soft-binding](#page-180-0) [assertion](#page-180-0) present in the manifest. If there is not, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.softBindingMissing.
- g. For each template in the templates list:
  - i. If there is an icon field in the action-template-map-v2, then it shall be validated as described in [Section 15.10.3.3, "Validation of References"](#page-111-0).

#### <span id="page-109-0"></span>**15.10.3.2.4. c2pa.metadata validation**

If the assertion's label is c2pa.metadata, the validator shall ensure that the assertion does not contain fields outside the [allowed list](#page-273-0). If any field contained in the assertion is not in the allowed list, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.metadata.disallowed.

**NOTE**

This validation requirement will necessitate a validator parsing the JSON-LD data contained in the assertion.

#### **15.10.3.2.5. c2pa.session-keys validation**

If the assertion's label is c2pa.session-keys, the validator shall ensure that the signerBinding signature is correct (which indicates that the session key private key is known to the Signer). This is done by verifying that the signerBinding signature successfully validates (using the session key), and that the payload of the signature is the Signer's end-entity certificate . Session keys are only valid if the signerBinding signature is successfully validated.

#### **15.10.3.2.6. c2pa.time-stamp validation**

If the assertion's label is c2pa.time-stamp, the validator shall ensure that the assertion is well-formed CBOR consisting of a single map (Major type 5) with at least one key/value pair. If this is not the case, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.timestamp.malformed.

Since validation of the time-stamp token is performed as described in [Section 15.8.2, "Validating the](#page-100-0) [TimeStampToken"](#page-100-0), the validator needs to store the time-stamp token (and its associated C2PA Manifest identifier) for later use.

#### <span id="page-110-0"></span>**15.10.3.2.7. c2pa.alternative-content-representation validation**

If the assertion's label is c2pa.alternative-content-representation, a validator shall perform the following steps:

1. If the type field is exif.originalPreservationImage, the validator shall proceed to the original preservation image representation validation defined in original-preservation-imagerepresentation validation.

#### **original-preservation-image-representation validation**

- 1. Check that no more than one c2pa.alternative-content-representation assertion where the type field is exif.originalPreservationImage is present in the active manifest. If more than one is found, the active manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.alternativeContentRepresentation.malformed.
- 2. The original-preservation-image-params contains either the multiAssetPartIndex field or the embeddedOriginalPreservationImage field. If both fields are present, or neither is present, the assertion shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.alternativeContentRepresentation.malformed.
- 3. If the multiAssetPartIndex field is present and parameters is present in the active manifest:
  - a. If the active manifest does not include a c2pa.hash.multi-asset assertion, the assertion shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.alternativeContentRepresentation.malformed.
  - b. The multiAssetPartIndex field shall be a valid zero-based index for an element within the parts array of the located c2pa.hash.multi-asset assertion. If the index is out of bounds (i.e., greater than or equal to the total length of the parts array), the assertion shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.alternativeContentRepresentation.malformed.

- 4. If the embeddedOriginalPreservationImage field is present:
  - a. Resolve the URI reference in the embeddedOriginalPreservationImage field to obtain the data of this embedded data assertion.
  - b. The embeddedOriginalPreservationImage field shall be a hashed-uri-map structure, and its hash field shall be present. If this hash field is missing, the assertion shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.alternativeContentRepresentation.malformed.
  - c. Compute the hash of the resolved embedded data using the determined algorithm. If the computed hash does not match the hash value provided in the embeddedOriginalPreservationImage field, the assertion shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.alternativeContentRepresentation.hashMismatch.
- 5. If no failure codes are encountered during the validation of the c2pa.alternative-contentrepresentation assertion, a success code of assertion.alternativeContentRepresentation.match shall be recorded.

#### <span id="page-111-0"></span>**15.10.3.3. Validation of References**

Some C2PA standard assertions support referencing other boxes in the C2PA Manifest via the use of a hashed\_uri and hashed\_ext\_uri. For example, there can be various references in [actions](#page-193-0), [ingredient,](#page-209-0) and [thumbnail](#page-190-0) assertions.

For all hashed\_uri and hashed\_ext\_uri fields in standard assertions, except for the activeManifest field in c2pa.ingredient.v3 (for which special validation behavior is specified in [Section 15.11.3, "Ingredient Assertion](#page-113-0) [Validation"](#page-113-0)), the validator shall perform the following validation: . For a hashed\_ext\_uri whose resource the validator chooses to retrieve, the validator shall perform the steps described in [Section 15.10.4.2, "Validation of](#page-112-1) [External References".](#page-112-1) . For a hashed\_uri, the validator shall perform the steps described below.

The destination of a hashed\_uri is found in its url field. If the field is not present or the destination cannot be located (i.e., that data isn't present where it is supposed to be) then it shall be treated as a validation failure with code hashedURI.missing.

If the destination can be located, then proceed as follows: . Follow the procedure in [Section 15.4, "Determining the](#page-94-1) [hashing algorithm"](#page-94-1) to determine the hash algorithm and any possible failure codes. . Ensure that the hash field is present in the hashed\_uri structure. If it is not, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of hashedURI.mismatch. . Compute the hash of the assertion using the determined hash algorithm and the procedure described in [Section 8.4.2.3, "Hashing JUMBF Boxes"](#page-39-0). . Compare the computed hash value with the value in the hash field. If they do not match, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of hashedURI.mismatch.

## **15.10.4. External Data Validation**

#### **15.10.4.1. General**

A [cloud data assertion](#page-188-0) contains the URI references to (and hashes of) externally hosted assertion data. Those references are not retrieved and validated as part of standard validation. A validator shall first successfully validate a claim before attempting to retrieve the external data referenced. A validator shall not attempt to retrieve external data from a rejected claim. As the retrieval of external data is optional, the inability to retrieve or validate external data shall not cause a claim to be rejected.

If a validator chooses to retrieve any of the external data in a cloud data assertion, the validator shall performs the steps described in [Section 15.10.4.2, "Validation of External References".](#page-112-1) If successful, the retrieved externally hosted assertions shall be validated as if the same assertion were embedded.

### <span id="page-112-1"></span>**15.10.4.2. Validation of External References**

The following procedure shall be used to validate the external data referenced in a cloud data assertion:

- 1. Resolve the URI reference in the url field to obtain its data. If the url field is not present or the URI cannot be resolved and the data retrieved, the validator shall abort the attempt to retrieve the external data.
- 2. If the size of the retrieved data is not equal to the value of the size field, the validator shall return a failure code of assertion.hashedURI.mismatch to the application and not provide the retrieved data.
- 3. Validate that the content type returned in the Content-Type header of the HTTP response is equal to the declared content type. If they do not match, the validator shall return a failure code of assertion.hashedURI.mismatch to the application and not provide the retrieved data. The declared content type is determined by:
  - a. For external data, the content type is determined by the dc:format field of the hashed\_ext\_uri or unhashed\_ext\_uri structure. If the dc:format field is absent, content type validation is always successful.
  - b. For a cloud data assertion, if the dc:format field is not present in its location field and the content\_type field is not present, then the media type shall default to application/jumbf.
- 4. For a hashed\_ext\_uri, determine the hash algorithm to be used as specified in [Section 15.4.3, "For Hashed](#page-95-1) [Ext URIs"](#page-95-1) or possible failure codes.
  - a. Compute the hash of the data using the determined hash algorithm and the procedure described in [Section](#page-39-0) [8.4.2.3, "Hashing JUMBF Boxes"](#page-39-0) on the retrieved content. For external data, use the hash algorithm and the exact retrieved content as input to the hash function.
  - b. Compare the computed hash value with the value in the hash field. If the hash field is not present or they do not match, the validator shall return a failure code of assertion.hashedURI.mismatch to the application and not provide the retrieved data.
  - c. Otherwise, the validator shall record a success code of assertion.hashedURI.match and provide the retrieved data to the application.

## <span id="page-112-0"></span>**15.11. Validate the Ingredients**

## **15.11.1. Explanation**

A validator shall perform the [validation steps](#page-82-1) for the asset being presented and its active manifest. If any of the steps conclude the active manifest is invalid, that manifest shall be rejected with the indicated failure code.

An asset's active manifest may list one or more ingredients, through the use of [ingredient assertions](#page-209-0). Some of those ingredients may have their own manifests associated with them, and some of those manifests may themselves have ingredients and ingredient manifests.

## **15.11.2. Processing Ingredient Manifests**

#### **15.11.2.1. Standard Manifests in an ingredient**

When processing a [standard manifest,](#page-62-1) a validator shall validate each ingredient (regardless of the value of its relationship field), as described [below](#page-113-0).

#### **15.11.2.2. Update Manifests in an ingredient**

For [update manifests](#page-63-0), the parentOf ingredient of the update manifest shall be validated as described [below.](#page-113-0)

#### **15.11.2.3. Time-Stamp Manifests in an ingredient**

**IMPORTANT**

This feature has been deprecated in favour of the [time-stamp assertion.](#page-224-0) The information below is retained for historical purposes.

Any [time-stamp manifests](#page-64-3) found in an ingredient shall be ignored.

## <span id="page-113-0"></span>**15.11.3. Ingredient Assertion Validation**

### **15.11.3.1. Validation Overview**

<span id="page-114-0"></span>![](_page_114_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 14. Ingredient Validation

The flowchart in [Figure 14, "Ingredient Validation"](#page-114-0) describes the process of validating any ingredient assertions contained in a given C2PA Manifest.

**NOTE**

If there are any discrepancies between the visual representation and the text, the text is considered authoritative.

#### <span id="page-115-0"></span>**15.11.3.2. Performing explicit validation**

If the relationship field is not present in an ingredient assertion, the assertion shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.ingredient.malformed.

The value of the relationship field shall be one of the following: parentOf, inputTo, or componentOf. If the value of the relationship field is not one of these, the assertion shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.ingredient.malformed.

#### **15.11.3.3. Performing recursive validation**

The validator shall recursively validate all ingredient manifests in the asset, for example using a depth-first search as described below. A validator need not implement the algorithm exactly as described, but the results of the validation shall be equivalent to the results of this algorithm.

- 1. Create two empty lists:
  - a. A list to hold the hashed\_uri values of all ingredient manifests used in the asset, anywhere in its lineage.
  - b. A list to hold the JUMBF URIs of all redacted assertions in the asset, anywhere in its lineage.
- 2. Set the active manifest of the asset being validated as the target manifest
- 3. Begin recursion.
- 4. Locate the claim, as described in [Section 15.6, "Locating and Validating the Claim".](#page-98-0) If unable to, reject claim with a claim.missing failure code.
- 5. If the claim of the target manifest contains a redacted\_assertions field, check the JUMBF URI of each redacted assertion.
  - a. If the redacted assertion is from the target manifest, reject the claim with an assertion.selfRedacted failure code.
  - b. Otherwise, append the JUMBF URI of the redacted assertion to the list of all redacted assertions.
- 6. If the claim of the target manifest includes ingredient assertions:
  - a. For each ingredient assertion:
    - i. Attempt to resolve the hashed URI of the ingredient assertion. If the URI does not resolve, or the hash does not match, or the assertion's JUMBF Content boxes contain only zeros, skip to the next ingredient assertion.
    - ii. If the ingredient assertion has an activeManifest field (or c2pa\_manifest field in a v1 or v2 ingredient assertion):

- A. Append a tuple that includes the following values to the list of all ingredient manifests:
  - The hashed\_uri value of the activeManifest (or c2pa\_manifest) field in the ingredient assertion
  - The hashed\_uri value of the claimSignature field in the ingredient assertion
- B. Set the just-appended ingredient manifest as the target manifest, and repeat the process as above from the "Begin recursion" step.
- iii. If the ingredient assertion does not have an activeManifest (or c2pa\_manifest) field, record an ingredient.unknownProvenance informational code unless the value of the relationship field is inputTo, and then skip to the next ingredient assertion until they are all exhausted. At that point, return from the current recursion level.
- 7. If the claim of the target manifest does not include ingredient assertions, return from the current recursion level.
- 8. End recursion.

Having compiled a list of all ingredient manifests and a list of all redacted assertions, the validator shall perform the following validation algorithm:

- 1. For each ingredient manifest in the list of all ingredient manifests:
  - a. Extract the [manifest label](#page-35-1) from the ingredient manifest JUMBF URI from each tuple
  - b. Search the list of all redacted assertions for assertions with a matching [manifest label](#page-35-1)
  - c. If one or more matching redacted assertions are found:
    - i. Validate the ingredient using the claim signature hash validation method, described in [Section](#page-117-0) [15.11.3.3.1, "Claim Signature Hash Validation Method".](#page-117-0)
  - d. If no matching redacted assertions are found:
    - i. Validate the ingredient using either the manifest hash validation method, described in [Section](#page-117-1) [15.11.3.3.2, "Manifest Hash Validation Method",](#page-117-1) or the claim signature hash validation method, described in [Section 15.11.3.3.1, "Claim Signature Hash Validation Method"](#page-117-0).
  - e. If the ingredient assertion contains a validationResults field:
    - i. For each entry in the value of the validationResults field, if an equivalent entry was not returned as part of the validation process, return it as part of the validation results.
    - ii. If there are any entries returned as part of the validation process that are not present in the validationResults field, return it as part of the validation results.
  - f. If no validationResults field is present and the ingredient assertion is a v3 ingredient assertion with the activeManifest field present, then return the failure code assertion.ingredient.malformed.

Validators should ignore any additional C2PA Manifests that appear in the C2PA Manifest Store but are not in the list of ingredient manifests.

**NOTE** Ignoring additional C2PA Manifests supports compatibility with custom assertions and future

#### <span id="page-117-0"></span>**15.11.3.3.1. Claim Signature Hash Validation Method**

This method includes a full validation of the ingredient's claim, like that performed for the active manifest, except that content bindings are not evaluated:

- 1. Resolve the URI reference in the url value of the claimSignature field to obtain the ingredient's claim signature box. If the URI reference cannot be resolved, or the claimSignature field is not present, the ingredient claim is rejected with a failure code of ingredient.claimSignature.missing.
- 2. Determine the hash algorithm identifier (or possible failure code) by following the procedure in [Section 15.4,](#page-94-1) ["Determining the hashing algorithm".](#page-94-1)
- 3. Compute the hash of the ingredient claim signature box using that algorithm and the procedure described in [Section 8.4.2.3, "Hashing JUMBF Boxes".](#page-39-0)
- 4. Compare the computed hash with the value in the hash field.
  - a. If the hashes are not equal or the hash field is not present:
    - i. Reject the claim with a failure code of ingredient.claimSignature.mismatch.
  - b. If the hashes are equal, issue a ingredient.claimSignature.validated.
    - i. Validate the claim signature, time-stamp, and credential revocation information as per [Section 15.7,](#page-98-1) ["Validate the Signature"](#page-98-1), [Section 15.8, "Validate the Time-Stamp"](#page-99-0), and [Section 15.9, "Validate the](#page-102-0) [Credential Revocation Information".](#page-102-0)
    - ii. For each URI in the list of redacted assertions with a matching [manifest label,](#page-35-1) if the referenced assertion is present and any JUMBF Content box or padding box within it contains anything other than zero or more 0x00 bytes, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.notRedacted.
    - iii. Validate each non-redacted assertion per [Section 15.10, "Validate the Assertions"](#page-104-0), except for the hard binding assertions, which cannot be validated for ingredients.

When using the claim signature hash validation method, the validator shall not record hash mismatch failure codes for the activeManifest field.

**NOTE**

The reason for this is that if redactions affect the referenced manifest, it is possible that the hash for this field would not match.

#### <span id="page-117-1"></span>**15.11.3.3.2. Manifest Hash Validation Method**

An ingredient manifest that has not been changed due to redaction can be validated faster if the current validator trusts the previous claim generator's validation results:

1. Resolve the URI reference in the url value of the activeManifest field to obtain the ingredient's manifest box. If the url field is not present or the URI reference cannot be resolved, the ingredient claim is rejected with a failure code of ingredient.manifest.missing.

- 2. Determine the hash algorithm identifier (or possible failure code) by following the procedure in [Section 15.4,](#page-94-1) ["Determining the hashing algorithm".](#page-94-1)
- 3. Compute the hash of the ingredient manifest box using that algorithm and the procedure described in [Section](#page-39-0) [8.4.2.3, "Hashing JUMBF Boxes".](#page-39-0)
- 4. Compare the computed hash with the value in the hash field.
  - a. If the hashes are not equal or the hash field is not present:
    - i. Reject the claim with a failure code of ingredient.manifest.mismatch.
  - b. If the hashes are equal, the ingredient is fully validated and a ingredient.manifest.validated success code is issued.

## <span id="page-118-0"></span>**15.12. Validate the Asset's Content**

The asset's content shall be validated using the [hard binding](#page-41-2) in the active manifest if the active manifest is a standard manifest. If the active manifest is an update manifest, the hard binding shall be found in the parentOf ingredient's manifest, or if that manifest is also an update manifest, by following the chain of parentOf ingredients to the first standard manifest. If no standard manifest is found, or the standard manifest has no hard binding, then the active manifest's claim shall be rejected with a failure code of claim.hardBindings.missing.

An asset may also be composed of multiple parts, where each part has its own associated hash (see [Section 18.9,](#page-176-0) ["Multi-Asset Hash"\)](#page-176-0) which may be validated separately. For example, an asset may consist of separate static image & video parts, each of which can be validated separately.

## **15.12.1. Validating a data hash**

#### **15.12.1.1. General**

Once a standard manifest (and its bindings) has been located, the exclusion range(s) shall be extracted from the c2pa.hash.data assertion.

If the ending byte offset of one exclusion range (start + length) is greater than the starting byte offset of the next exclusion range in the array, or a start or length value is negative, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.dataHash.malformed.

If any update manifests were encountered then the length value of the exclusion range whose start value is the offset of the start of the entire C2PA Manifest Store shall be treated as the current length of the entire C2PA Manifest Store plus any file format specific extras. The difference between this new length and the length specified in the exclusion represents an adjustment value. Any other exclusion ranges that occur after this C2PA exclusion range must be modified to reflect the fact that all content after the C2PA Manifest Store has been shifted; the start value of each subsequent exclusion range must be incremented by the adjustment value.

Follow the procedure in [Section 15.4, "Determining the hashing algorithm"](#page-94-1) to determine the hash algorithm and any possible failure codes. The hash shall be computed over the bytes of the asset, except for those specified in the exclusion range(s). If the end of an exclusion range falls beyond the end of the asset, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.dataHash.mismatch.

If the hash algorithm specified in the alg field does not appear in the allowed or deprecated list in [Section 13.1,](#page-67-1) ["Hashing"](#page-67-1), then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of algorithm.unsupported. If the hash field is not present, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.dataHash.mismatch.

A validator shall ensure that the data contained within the exclusion range containing the C2PA Manifest Store consists of only the C2PA Manifest Store and any appropriate padding (e.g., zero'd data) in clearly marked pad fields or free/skip boxes. If a validator encounters any data other than what is permitted, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.dataHash.mismatch.

If a validator encounters exclusion ranges other than for just the C2PA Manifest Store and appropriate padding (e.g., zero'd data), such as for all or part of the asset metadata (as described in [Section 9.2.6, "Binding Non-C2PA Asset](#page-42-1) [Metadata"](#page-42-1)), the informational code assertion.dataHash.additionalExclusionsPresent shall be issued.

**NOTE**

The combination of exclusion ranges and padding values, especially padding needed to support multi-pass processing workflows, may enable an attacker to replace parts of that padding with arbitrary data that could impact the consumption of the asset without invalidating the hash.

The validator shall ignore the presence and contents of pad and pad2 fields.

If no error conditions were encountered, the validator shall add the success code assertion.dataHash.match to the list it eventually returns.

If the hash computed over all the asset's data (minus any exclusion ranges) does not match the value of the hash field in the c2pa.hash.data, then the validator shall look for presence of a [multi-asset hash assertion.](#page-176-0) If one is present, it shall be validated as described in [Section 15.12.4, "Validating a multi-asset hash"](#page-125-0), but if one is not present, the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.dataHash.mismatch.

#### **15.12.1.2. Hashing of JPEG 1 files**

In JPEG 1 files, the file format extras described above would include any APP11 markers and their respective segment length bytes for APP11 segments. Because the segment lengths are inside the exclusion range, a validator shall match the total length of the exclusion range with that of the total length of all APP11 segments representing the C2PA Manifest to ensure that the length was not tampered with.

**NOTE**

A JPEG 1 file can contain APP11 segments for reasons other than C2PA (e.g., JPEG 360 or JPEG Privacy and Security) and those are not included in these calculations.

#### **15.12.1.3. Hashing of Unstructured Text**

#### <span id="page-119-0"></span>**15.12.1.3.1. Validating a text data hash**

For assets consisting of unstructured text with an embedded C2PATextManifestWrapper, validators shall perform the following when validating a c2pa.hash.data hard binding:

- 1. Locate all valid C2PATextManifestWrapper instances as described in [Locating the manifest in unstructured](#page-271-0) [text](#page-271-0).
- 2. Identify the wrapper(s) whose byte range exactly matches the exclusion range(s) specified in the exclusions field of the c2pa.hash.data assertion.
- 3. If no wrapper matches the exclusions, reject with assertion.dataHash.malformed.
- 4. If more than one wrapper matches the exclusions, reject with manifest.text.multipleWrappers.
- 5. Remove the wrapper bytes from the text according to the exclusion range(s).
- 6. Normalize the remaining text to NFC (Normalization Form Canonical Composition).
- 7. Encode the normalized text as UTF-8 bytes.
- 8. Compute the hash over these bytes using the algorithm specified by the alg field of the c2pa.hash.data assertion (see [Determining the hashing algorithm](#page-94-1) and [Algorithm validation](#page-95-2)).
- 9. Compare the computed hash with the hash value stored in the c2pa.hash.data assertion.
  - a. If the hashes match, record the success code assertion.dataHash.match.
  - b. If the hashes do not match, reject with the failure code assertion.dataHash.mismatch.

#### **15.12.1.3.2. Handling Corrupted Wrappers**

If the C2PATextManifestWrapper is found but appears to be corrupted (invalid version, algorithm, or manifest length):

- 1. The validator shall reject the manifest with a failure code of manifest.text.corruptedWrapper
- 2. If possible, the validator should provide details about the specific corruption detected

#### **15.12.1.3.3. Validation Result Codes**

Standard result codes for text validation:

- assertion.dataHash.match: Data hash validation succeeded
- assertion.dataHash.mismatch: Data hash does not match, indicating tampering
- assertion.dataHash.malformed: The data hash assertion is malformed (e.g., invalid exclusion ranges)
- manifest.text.corruptedWrapper: The C2PATextManifestWrapper was found but is corrupted
- manifest.text.multipleWrappers: Multiple valid wrappers were found in the same text

#### **15.12.1.3.4. Partial Text Extraction**

If text with an embedded manifest is partially copied:

- 1. The validator should detect that the manifest is incomplete or invalid
- 2. The validator shall reject the manifest with an appropriate failure code

3. If possible, the validator should indicate that the text appears to be a fragment of a larger, signed text

## **15.12.2. Validating a BMFF-hash**

For any portions of an asset rendered for presentation to a user, including but not limited to audio, video, or text, the corresponding hard binding corresponding to the rendered content shall be validated in accordance with [Section 9.2,](#page-41-2) ["Hard Bindings"](#page-41-2). If the standard hard binding does not validate, and a multi-asset hash assertion is present, it shall be validated as described in [Section 15.12.4, "Validating a multi-asset hash"](#page-125-0). If at any time content fails to be validated, the validator shall clearly signal to the user that some of the content does not match the claim, and if possible, should indicate what part of the content did not validate. If any content is absent for which content bindings exist, discovery of this absence is also a validation failure. The validator shall continue to report validation has failed, even if later portions of the content validate correctly.

For content that is not wholly available before rendering begins, such as during adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) and progressive download, absence of not-yet-available portions of content is not considered a validation failure. As the content becomes available, the validator shall validate each portion of the content before it is rendered as previously described. In addition, the validator shall validate that the sequence of said content is the same as when the manifest was produced. Unless the player has explicitly signalled the validator that a discontinuity is expected (e.g., when the consumer performs a manual seek operation via the UI), the validator shall clearly signal to the user that an unexpected discontinuity has occurred whenever the sequence does not match. This includes validating that the location values for a given Merkle tree start at zero and increments by one for each following chunk; equivalently, the location value always indicates which chunk is being rendered.

For content that is to be validated during playback via progressive download, the leaf nodes of the merkle tree may align to synchronization points of the video track in the 'mdat' (e.g., the RAP points random access points). When the 'variableBlockSizes' are setup to achieve such alignment, validation during linear playback or seeking to desired playback time can be both achieved via the same sequence. The desired blocks shall be fetched, validated and the tracks within them selected for rendering.

For content that is intentionally not being rendered as the claim generator originally intended, such as during fastforward, rewind, or playback at a different speed, the validator may not be able to validate the content. In this case, the validator shall clearly signal to the user that the content cannot be validated during the corresponding operation.

For content with [C2PA ContentProvenanceBox](#page-259-0) with box\_purpose set to update presence, the active manifest is first searched in the [C2PA ContentProvenanceBox](#page-259-0) with box\_purpose set to update then in the [C2PA](#page-259-0) [ContentProvenanceBox](#page-259-0) with box\_purpose set to original. If the active manifest is in the [C2PA](#page-259-0) [ContentProvenanceBox](#page-259-0) with box\_purpose set to update, trace the ingredient parent chain (looking in either [C2PA](#page-259-0) [ContentProvenanceBox](#page-259-0) with box\_purpose set to update or original as needed) until the first non update manifest is found. The BMFF hash of this manifest content shall be validated in accordance with [Section 9.2, "Hard](#page-41-2) [Bindings"](#page-41-2). The addition of an [C2PA ContentProvenanceBox](#page-259-0) with box\_purpose set to update should not affect the hash calculation since it was added to the end of the file not changing any offsets.

If the bmff-hash-map does not contain an exclusions field or that field's value is not of type array with at least one entry, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.bmffHash.malformed.

If a validator encounters exclusion ranges other than for just the C2PA Manifest Store and appropriate padding (e.g., zero'd data), such as for all or part of the asset metadata (as described in [Section 9.2.6, "Binding Non-C2PA Asset](#page-42-1) [Metadata"](#page-42-1)), the informational code assertion.bmffHash.additionalExclusionsPresent shall be issued.

The validator shall ignore the presence and contents of pad and pad2 fields.

Determine the hash algorithm identifier (or possible failure code) by following the procedure in [Section 15.4,](#page-94-1) ["Determining the hashing algorithm".](#page-94-1)

If the ending byte offset of one subset range (offset + length) is greater than the offset value of the next range in the array, or an offset or length value is negative, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.bmffHash.malformed. The assertion.bmffHash.mismatch failure code is used for all other failures described in this section. Otherwise, the validator shall add the success code assertion.bmffHash.match to the list it eventually returns.

If the BMFF hashing process produces a assertion.bmffHash.mismatch failure code, then the validator shall look for presence of a [multi-asset hash assertion.](#page-176-0) If one is present, the assertion.bmffHash.mismatch failure code shall not be issued, and instead the multi-asset hash assertion shall be validated as described in [Section 15.12.4,](#page-125-0) ["Validating a multi-asset hash";](#page-125-0) otherwise, the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.bmffHash.mismatch.

#### **15.12.2.1. Non-fragmented asset using Merkle tree**

If the bmff-hash-map.merkle field is present, the validator shall [validate the Merkle tree](#page-163-0). If the merklemap.fixedBlockSize and merkle-map.variableBlockSizes fields are not present, the whole payload of the mdat is treated as a single leaf node for hash calculation. If the fixedBlockSize is present and if variableBlockSizes is not present, the payload of the mdat is divided into fixed-length blocks, and each block is treated as a leaf node. If the final block exceeds the end of the mdat payload, the size of the last block should be set to extend only to the end of the mdat payload. If the variableBlockSize is present and if fixedBlockSizes is not present, the payload of the mdat is divided into sizes defined by the array of variableBlockSizes. If the number of elements is not equal to count or sum of the values is not equal to size of payload of mdat, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.bmffHash.malformed. If the merklemap.fixedBlockSize and merkle-map.variableBlockSizes fields are present, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.bmffHash.malformed.

- If merkle-map.count is equal to the number of elements of merkle-map.hashes, and if the hash of a leaf node doesn't match the corresponding element of merkle-map.hashes, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.bmffHash.mismatch.
- If merkle-map.count is larger than the number of elements of merkle-map.hashes, and if the auxiliary uuid C2PA box doesn't exist as described in [Section A.5.4, "Auxiliary](#page-261-0) ['c2pa'](#page-261-0) [Boxes for Large and Fragmented](#page-261-0) [Files",](#page-261-0) then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.bmffHash.malformed. If the hash calculated from the auxiliary uuid C2PA box and leaf node doesn't match the corresponding element of merkle-map.hashes, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.bmffHash.mismatch.

• If merkle-map.count is smaller than the number of calculated leaf nodes (either the number of auxiliary uuid C2PA boxes or the number of leaf node merkle-map.hashes), then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.bmffHash.malformed.

#### **15.12.2.2. Fragmented asset using Merkle tree**

If the bmff-hash-map.merkle field is present, the validator shall [validate the Merkle tree.](#page-163-0) If the auxiliary uuid C2PA box doesn't exist as described in [Section A.5.4, "Auxiliary](#page-261-0) ['c2pa'](#page-261-0) [Boxes for Large and Fragmented Files"](#page-261-0), then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.bmffHash.malformed. If the hash calculated from the auxiliary uuid C2PA box and leaf node doesn't match the corresponding element of merklemap.hashes, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.bmffHash.mismatch

### <span id="page-123-0"></span>**15.12.3. Validating a general box hash**

Once a standard manifest (and its bindings) has been located, the list of boxes to be validated shall be extracted from the boxes field of the box-map structure stored in the c2pa.hash.boxes assertion. If no such field is present, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.boxesHash.malformed.

The boxes shall appear in the asset in the same order that they appear in the boxes array, including the box containing the C2PA Manifest. If there are any other boxes present in the asset, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.boxesHash.unknownBox. If the boxes appear out of order, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.boxesHash.mismatch.

The hash algorithm for each box-hash-map shall be determined by its alg field, or if that is not present, by the alg field in the containing box-map, or if that is not present, by the alg field in the Claim. If the hash algorithm is not specified in any of these places, or does not appear in the allowed or deprecated list in [Section 13.1, "Hashing"](#page-67-1), then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of algorithm.unsupported.

Refer to boxIndex to determine which box the exclusion ranges indicated in the exclusions field correspond to. If the box indicated by boxIndex does not exist, the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.boxesHash.malformed. The start that indicates the beginning of an exclusion range specifies an offset measured from the start of the box indicated by boxIndex. If the ending byte offset of one exclusion range (start + length) is greater than the starting byte offset of the next exclusion range in the array, or a start or length value is negative, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.boxesHash.malformed.

The validator shall ignore the presence and contents of pad and pad2 fields.

Follow the procedure in [Section 15.4, "Determining the hashing algorithm"](#page-94-1) to determine the hash algorithm and any possible failure codes. The hash shall be computed over the bytes of the asset, except for the ranges specified in the exclusions field and any boxes where excluded field is true. If the end of an exclusion range falls beyond the end of the box that contains the exclusion range, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.boxesHash.mismatch.

The combination of exclusion ranges and padding values, especially padding needed to support multi-pass

processing workflows, may enable an attacker to replace parts of that padding with arbitrary data that could impact the consumption of the asset without invalidating the hash. For this reason a validator shall ensure that the data contained within the exclusion range including a C2PA Manifest Store consists only of the C2PA Manifest Store and appropriate padding (e.g., zero'd data) in clearly marked pad fields or free/skip boxes. Within other exclusion ranges than above C2PA Manifest Store, all or part of the asset metadata may also be included as described in [Section 9.2.6,](#page-42-1) ["Binding Non-C2PA Asset Metadata"](#page-42-1). If a validator encounters any data other than those permitted above, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.boxesHash.mismatch. If a validator encounters exclusion ranges other than that for the C2PA Manifest Store and appropriate padding (e.g., zero'd data) in clearly marked pad fields or free/skip boxes, an informational code assertion.boxesHash.additionalExclusionsPresent shall be set.

If the hash value for any box does not match, and that box does not have an excluded field with a value of true, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.boxesHash.mismatch.

If any box-hash-map in the boxes array does not contain a names field, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.boxesHash.malformed.

For each box listed in the names and boxes array, the specified hash algorithm shall be computed over the bytes of the box (along with any associated header). If there are multiple entries in a names array, the hash value for that range of boxes shall be computed from the start of the first box (in the range) until the end of the last box (in the range). This would include any arbitrary bytes that may be present between boxes.

If the hash field is not present, or any resultant hash does not match the value of the hash field for those boxes, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.boxesHash.mismatch. If the box hashing process produces a assertion.boxesHash.mismatch failure code, then the validator shall look for presence of a [multi-asset hash assertion](#page-176-0). If one is present, it shall be validated as described in [Section 15.12.4, "Validating a multi](#page-125-0)[asset hash"](#page-125-0), but if one is not present, the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.boxesHash.mismatch.

Otherwise, the validator shall add the success code assertion.boxesHash.match to the list it eventually returns.

#### **15.12.3.1. JPEG Special Handling**

When validating a JPEG, a validator shall check that each box identified with the special C2PA box identifier is indeed an APP11 containing some or all of the C2PA Manifest Store. The C2PA Manifest Store is identified by it being a JUMBF superbox with a label of c2pa and a JUMBF type UUID of 63327061-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 as described in [Section 11.1.4.2, "Manifest Store"](#page-58-2).

If an APP11 that is not part of the C2PA Manifest Store is present and not included in the list of hashed boxes, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.boxesHash.unknownBox.

#### **15.12.3.2. Font Special Handling**

When validating a font, a validator shall check that the box corresponding with the font's C2PA table is present, and

determine whether it contains an embedded manifest, a remote manifest URI or both.

If any font tables are present which are not covered by any box, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.boxesHash.unknownBox.

## <span id="page-125-0"></span>**15.12.4. Validating a multi-asset hash**

If the standard validation of the asset's hard binding fails, and the asset contains a multi-asset hash assertion, then the validator shall proceed to validate the multi-asset hash assertion. If more than one multi-asset hash assertion is present, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.multiAssetHash.malformed.

Validation of the multi-asset hash assertion (c2pa.hash.multi-asset) shall be performed by iterating over the array of parts in the multi-asset-hash-map. If the parts field is not present, or it is present with a value that is an empty array, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.multiAssetHash.malformed.

For each part, the validator shall ensure that it contains both valid a locator and a valid hashAssertion field. If either of these are missing, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.multiAssetHash.malformed.

If the locator is a byte-offset-locator, then the validator shall ensure that the byteOffset and length fields are present and non-negative. If these conditions are not met, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.multiAssetHash.malformed.

If the locator is a bmffBox, then the validator shall ensure that the specified box is present in the asset. If the box is not present, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.multiAssetHash.malformed.

Given a valid locator and hash, the validator shall attempt to locate the part using the locator information. If it is not present, and the optional field is either not present or present with a value of false, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.multiAssetHash.missingPart. If the optional field is present with a value of true, then the validator shall skip over this part and continue with the next part.

**NOTE**

Discarding certain parts may prevent a validator from being able to unambiguously identify the remaining parts. In most cases, only one or more parts at the end of the file, rather than any parts in the middle, can be discarded effectively.

If the located parts are overlapping or do not, in aggregate, cover every byte of the asset, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.multiAssetHash.malformed.

For each located part, the validator shall compute the hash of the part using the specified algorithm & methodology (i.e., data hash, general box hash, or BMFF hash) over the bytes of the part. Any uses of absolute byte offsets in a part's hash assertion (e.g., the start value in a data hash exclusion range) shall be interpreted relative to the beginning of that part. If the part is truncated (shorter than the length in the locator), or the resultant hash does not match the value present in the hard binding assertion referenced from the hashAssertion field, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.multiAssetHash.mismatch.

If the hash assertion for each located part validates successfully, then the validator shall record the success code assertion.multiAssetHash.match and shall not record any failure codes associated with the asset's hard binding.

## **15.12.5. Validating a collection data hash**

#### **15.12.5.1. General**

Validation of a collection data hash assertion (c2pa.hash.collection.data) that has been located in a standard manifest shall be performed by iterating over the array of uris in the collection-data-hash-map. If there is no uris field present, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.collectionHash.malformed.

Follow the procedure in [Section 15.4, "Determining the hashing algorithm"](#page-94-1) to determine the hash algorithm and any possible failure codes. Once determined, hashing shall be processed as specified in [Section 15.4.4, "Algorithm](#page-95-2) [validation".](#page-95-2)

For each uri-hashed-data-map in the uris array, the validator shall ensure that it contains both a uri and a hash field. If either of these fields are missing, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.collectionHash.malformed.

In order to avoid any potential security concerns, a validator shall validate the URIs (i.e., the value of the uri field) before use, ensuring that neither . nor .. appear as part of the URI. If either of these are found in a URI, the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.collectionHash.invalidURI.

For the asset retrieved from the URI, its hash shall be computing using the specified algorithm over all bytes of its data. If the resultant hash does not match the value of the hash field, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.collectionHash.mismatch. Otherwise, the validator shall add the success code assertion.collectionHash.match to the list it eventually returns.

If there are any files listed in the collection data hash assertion that are not found by the validator, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.collectionHash.incorrectFileCount.

### **15.12.5.2. Extras for ZIP**

In a ZIP file with an associated C2PA Manifest, the [collection data hash](#page-173-0) contains the additional zip\_central\_directory\_hash field. As described [earlier](#page-267-0), this field contains a hash of every "central directory header" in the ZIP Central Directory as well as the the "end of central directory record" (which is the last part of a ZIP file). The hash algorithm used for this field is the same as the one used for the hash field in the c2pa.hash.collection.data assertion.

When validating a ZIP file, the validator shall check that the zip\_central\_directory\_hash field is present and that the hash of the ZIP Central Directory and "end of central directory record" matches its value. If the hash does not

| match, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.collectionHash.mismatch. |

# <span id="page-128-0"></span>**Chapter 16. User Experience**

## <span id="page-128-1"></span>**16.1. Approach**

The C2PA intends to provide clear recommendations and guidance for implementers of provenance-enabled user experiences (UX). Developing these recommendations is an ongoing process that involves diverse stakeholders, with the results balancing uniformity and familiarity with utility and flexibility for users across contexts, platforms, and devices. These recommendations can be found in the [User experience guidance document](2.2@ux:UX_Recommendations.pdf).

## <span id="page-128-2"></span>**16.2. Principles**

The UX recommendations aim to define best practices for presenting C2PA provenance to consumers. The recommendations strive to describe standard, readily recognizable experiences that:

- provide asset creators a means to capture information and history about the content they are creating, and
- provide asset consumers information and history about the content they are experiencing, thereby empowering them to understand where it came from and decide how much to trust it.

User interfaces designed for the consumption of C2PA provenance shall be informed by the context of the asset. We have studied 4 primary user groups and a collection of contexts in which C2PA assets are encountered. These user groups have been defined in the [C2PA Guiding Principles](https://c2pa.org/principles/) as Consumers, Creators, Publishers and Verifiers (or Investigators). To serve the needs of each of these groups across common contexts, exemplary user interfaces are presented for many common cases. These are recommendations, not mandates, and we expect best practices to evolve.

# <span id="page-128-3"></span>**16.3. Disclosure Levels**

Because the complete set of C2PA data for a given asset can be overwhelming to a user, we describe 4 levels of progressive disclosure which guide the designs:

- Level 1: An indication that C2PA data is present and its cryptographic validation status.
- Level 2: A summary of C2PA data available for a given asset. This level should provide enough information for the particular content, user, and context to allow the consumer to understand to a sufficient degree how the asset came to its current state.
- Level 3: A detailed display of all relevant provenance data. Note that the relevance of certain items over others is contextual and determined by the UX implementer.
- Level 4: For sophisticated, forensic investigatory usage, a tool capable of revealing all the granular detail of signatures and trust signals is recommended.

## <span id="page-129-0"></span>**16.4. Public Review, Feedback and Evolution**

The team authoring the UX recommendations is cognizant of its limitations and potential biases, recognizing that feedback, review, user testing and ongoing evolution is a key requirement for success. The recommendations will therefore be an evolving document, informed by real world experiences deploying C2PA UX across a wide variety of applications and scenarios.

# <span id="page-130-0"></span>**Chapter 17. Information security**

## <span id="page-130-1"></span>**17.1. Threats and Security Considerations**

This section provides a summary of information security considerations and processes for technology described in the C2PA core specification. More detailed content will be provided in future releases of C2PA material including the Guidance document.

## **17.1.1. Context**

Information security is a principal concern of C2PA. C2PA maintains a threat model and security considerations for the C2PA specification. This effort complements other security-related work within C2PA. Associated documentation is currently in development and can be found at [Security Considerations.](2.0@security:Security_Considerations.pdf)

The C2PA is developing security considerations documentation that includes:

- A summary of relevant security features of C2PA technology
- Security considerations for practical use of C2PA technology
- Threats to C2PA technology and respective treatment of those threats, including countermeasures

## **17.1.2. Threat modelling process overview**

The C2PA builds security into our designs as they are being developed, but also expects that security design and threat modelling will continue as the system, ecosystem, and threat landscape evolve.

To this end, the C2PA uses a focused threat modelling process to support development of a strong security and privacy design. Outcomes of the effort directly support development of explicit threats and security considerations documentation, but also facilitate security thinking throughout the design process.

The threat modelling process combines synchronous (live) threat modelling sessions consisting of focused groups of subject matter experts (SMEs) with asynchronous development of content. The number of attendees in each synchronous session is kept small to promote efficient discussions, but all members of the C2PA have the opportunity to participate via either modality.

Like other security activities, we expect our threat modelling process to evolve with the C2PA ecosystem. Process documentation is considered a guide rather than a strict directive on how threat modelling works within the C2PA.

#### **17.1.2.1. References**

A variety of references and experiences are used to inform threat modelling and related security activities for the C2PA. This section provides a subset of public documents for reference.

## <span id="page-131-0"></span>**17.2. Harms, Misuse, and Abuse**

## **17.2.1. Introduction**

The C2PA [Guiding Principles](https://c2pa.org/principles/) establish that C2PA specifications shall be reviewed with a critical eye towards the potential abuse or misuse of the framework to cause unintended harms, threats to human rights, or disproportionate risks to vulnerable groups globally.

To ensure that the C2PA is meeting this aspect of its principles, the harms, misuse, and abuse assessment aims to identify and address potential concerns during the specifications development and as encountered in subsequent implementations.

In addition, the specifications are being reviewed to:

- Anticipate and mitigate potential abuse and misuse;
- Address common privacy concerns of its users; and
- Consider the needs of users and stakeholders throughout the world.

## **17.2.2. Considerations**

The harms, misuse, and abuse assessment is an ongoing process. The information presented in the [Harms Modelling](2.0@security:Harms_Modelling.pdf) [documentation](2.0@security:Harms_Modelling.pdf) should not be considered the end result of a comprehensive evaluation, but as a basis for ongoing discussions centered on impacted communities, and aimed at mitigating potential abuse and misuse and protecting human rights.

There are two critical aspects of the approach:

#### **Ongoing**

The harms, misuse, and abuse assessment necessarily accompanies the design and development, as well as implementation and use-stages of the C2PA by continuously informing the specifications development process, the implementation and user-experience guides, sensitization efforts, the governance of the Coalition and potentially multilateral cooperation for the promotion of a diverse C2PA ecosystem that serves a broad range of global contexts.

#### **Multi-disciplinary and diverse**

The harms, misuse, and abuse assessment should be a collaborative effort that includes multi-disciplinary experts and a broad range of stakeholders with lived, practical and technical experience of the issues from diverse geographical locations, cultural backgrounds and individual identities.

## **17.2.3. Assessment**

Harms modelling focuses on analysing how a socio-technical system might negatively impact users, other stakeholders or broader society, or otherwise create or re-enforce structures of injustice, threats to human rights, or disproportionate risks to vulnerable groups globally. The process of harms modelling systematically requires combining knowledge about a system architecture and its user affordances with historical and contextual evidence about the impact of similar existing systems on different social groups and participatory consultation with a range of communities who may be implicated by the system. This combined information frames the ability to anticipate harm and proactively identify responses.

The [Harms Modelling documentation](1.0@security:Harms_Modelling.pdf) describes the framework and the process carried out to date, followed by the methodology, an overview of the assessment, an outline for public review and feedback, and due diligence actions being developed to accompany version 1.0 of these specifications, its implementations and evolution.

## **17.2.4. Due Diligence Actions**

The harms, misuse and abuse assessment has informed, and should continue to inform, the development of the C2PA technical specifications as well as its accompanying documentation:

- [Guidance for implementers](2.2@guidance:Guidance.pdf)
- [User experience guidance](2.2@ux:UX_Recommendations.pdf)
- [Security Considerations](1.0@security:Security_Considerations.pdf)
- [Explainer](2.2@explainer:Explainer.pdf)

In addition, the harms, misuse and abuse assessment should inform the governance of the Coalition and guide potential multilateral cooperation for the promotion of a diverse C2PA ecosystem that pushes for the optimization of the benefits in terms of trust in media, user control and transparency that prompted the development of the C2PA specifications.

# <span id="page-133-0"></span>**Chapter 18. C2PA Standard Assertions**

## <span id="page-133-1"></span>**18.1. Introduction**

This section of the document lists the standard set of assertions for use by C2PA implementations, describing their syntax, usage, etc. To keep things simple, all example JUMBF URIs have been shortened for illustrative purposes - full URIs are necessary in the actual data.

All assertions shall have a label as described in [Section 6.2, "Labels"](#page-29-2) and shall be versioned as described in [Chapter 5,](#page-20-0) [Versioning](#page-20-0).

All C2PA standardized assertions use the JSON JUMBF content type, the CBOR JUMBF content type, or the Embedded File content type from ISO 19566-5:2023. Entity-specific assertions can be any of those, any of the other JUMBF content types from ISO 19566-5:2023, Annex B (such as XML) or may create its own (as per the instructions in ISO 19566-5:2023, Table B.1). The Codestream content type shall not be used for a C2PA assertion.

Unless otherwise mentioned, all assertions documented in this standard set of assertions shall be serialized as CBOR. All assertions that are serialized as CBOR shall comply with the Core Deterministic Encoding Requirements of CBOR (see [RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), clause 4.2.1) with their schemas defined using a [CDDL Definition.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610)

**NOTE** All CDDLs are non-normative.

For those defined using JSON, their schemas are defined using the latest version of [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/specification-links.html).

## <span id="page-133-2"></span>**18.2. Regions of Interest**

## **18.2.1. Description**

In some use cases, a given assertion, such as an [actions assertion,](#page-193-0) may only be relevant to a specific portion of an asset as opposed to the entire asset. In those cases, it is necessary to have a way to describe that region - whether it be temporal, spatial, textual or a combination of them. A region definition serves that purpose.

### **18.2.2. Common**

The most important part of the region definition is the range field which is used to describe a temporal range, a spatial range, a frame range, a textual range or a combination of them, for the region.

**NOTE**

While the specification allows for specifying a combination of ranges, it is not defined how a Manifest Consumer will use them. It is expected that the C2PA's User Experience Task Force will take this up in the future.

A region may also contain one of more common fields:

#### **name**

a free-text string representing a human-readable name for the region which might be used in a user interface.

#### **identifier**

a free-text string representing a machine-readable, unique to this assertion, identifier for the region.

#### **type**

a value from a controlled vocabulary such as <https://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/imageregiontype/>or an entity-specific value (e.g., com.litware.newType) that represents the type of thing(s) depicted by a region.

#### **description**

a free-text string.

Older versions of this specification included a role field. This field has been deprecated and shall no longer be included when generating a region of interest.

#### **18.2.2.1. Ranges**

All ranges consist of a type field whose value is either "spatial", "temporal", "frame", "textual" or "identified". In addition, it shall contain one of the following fields whose data is an object consisting of the specific data for that range:

- shape (for spatial);
- time (for temporal);
- frame (for temporal or textual);
- text (for textual);
- item (for specifically identified items).

#### **18.2.2.2. Spatial**

Spatial ranges are described using a shape object. A shape can be use to represent a rectangle, a circle or a polygon. It is modelled on the [Region Boundary Structure](http://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata#region-boundary-structure) from the IPTC.

#### **18.2.2.3. Temporal**

Temporal ranges are described using a time object, which represents a range from a starting time to an ending time. Times are normally described using a value that is relative to the start of the media. This is commonly referred to as "Normal Play Time" (npt) as described in [RFC 2326](http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2326) (as recommended in [W3C Media Fragments specification\)](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/#media-fragment-syntax). Alternatively, it is possible to refer to an absolute time (e.g., "10:00am"). Absolute times, sometimes referred to as "wall clock time", shall be specified using the Internet profile of [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) as described in [RFC 3339.](http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339)

**NOTE**

Absolute, or wall clock time, is useful in scenarios where the media asset represents activity that took place during a specific date and time period, such as a news broadcast or a live event.

If no type field is provided, the range shall be in npt format. If no start field is provided, the range shall start at the beginning of the asset. If no end field is provided, the range shall end at the end of the asset.

All start times are inclusive of that moment in time, and all end times are, by default, exclusive of it. The endInclusivity field may be set to inclusive to make the end time inclusive instead, which should be used where the range runs to the end of the asset.

For npt time ranges (expressed via a npt-time-map): If neither the start nor the end fields are provided, the range shall represent the entire asset.

For wallClock time ranges (expressed via a wall-clock-time-map): The end time shall not be earlier than the start time. At least one start or end field shall be provided. If one field is not provided, and the duration of the asset is available, the missing field is calculated by adding or subtracting the duration of the asset to/from the provided field. If the total asset duration is not available (such as for live streams), the time range extends forward or backward from the provided field, as appropriate, until the region is updated or the end of the asset is reached.

Where temporal ranges use fractions of a second, and not a sample or frame count, implementations should use the smallest number of decimal places possible to accurately represent the point in their media timeline. Where the fractions of a second do not align to a sample or frame boundary, and that is important for the validator or its user interface, implementations should choose the nearest sample or frame whose time is less than or equal to the specified time.

#### **18.2.2.4. Frames**

A frame object defines a range using the starting and ending frames or pages (inclusive). If no start is provided, the range shall start at the beginning of the asset. If no end is provided, the range shall end at the end of the asset. If neither is provided, the range shall represent the entire asset.

Frames are represented as a single ordinal numbers, where 0 is the first frame.

While frames are typically used to represent page numbers of a document, such as PDF, they may have uses in other media types, such as animation, video and audio. It is recommended that where possible, media types dealing with regions of interest over time use temporal ranges instead.

#### **18.2.2.5. Textual**

A text object defines a range using a one or more URL fragment identifiers, as defined by the [W3C Web Annotation](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#fragment-selector) [fragment selector](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#fragment-selector). It may also refine the range using offsets to the starting and ending characters (inclusive). If no start is provided, the range shall start at the beginning of the fragment. If no end is provided, the range shall end at the end of the fragment. If neither is provided, the range shall represent the entire fragment.

When used singularly, the fragment entry of the text-selector-map represents the entirety of the specified textual range. However, the text-selector-range-map supports a pair of text-selector-map objects. The value of selector is the start of the range (or its entirely, if no end entry is present) and the value of end (if present) represents the end of a contiguous range. In addition, multiple pairs may be used to represent a range that is not contiguous.

#### **18.2.2.6. Identified**

An item object defines a a media track, media item, or other discrete content item in the asset, allowing the claim generator to indicate assertions that apply to only a subset of the content carried in the asset's file container. For example, it could be used to indicate that only the audio track of a video file is relevant.

The media or content item is identified by an identifier string whose value should match the typical item identification naming scheme in that specific container format. For example, the value of identifier should be track\_id for MP4 files, and item\_ID for HEIF files. The value of the identifier is then provided in the value field. For example, a value of 2 with an identifier of track\_id in an MP4 video file container would indicate an assertion related to the second media track in the file (which could be the audio track).

Another use for identified ranges is to indicate a specific region by a known semantic value. For example, the [Foundational Model of Anatomy](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/FMA) could be used to identify a specific region of a human body. In such a case, the identifier shall be the URL or URI to where to locate the schema (though not necessary directly to a machine readable one).

## **18.2.3. Schema**

The schema for this type is defined by the region-map rule in the following [CDDL Definition](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610):

## <span id="page-142-0"></span>**18.3. Metadata About Assertions**

## **18.3.1. Description**

In many cases, it is useful or even necessary to provide additional information about an assertion, such as the date and time when it was generated or other data that may help Manifest Consumers to make informed decisions about the provenance or veracity of the assertion data.

**NOTE**

A Manifest Consumer is not required to read any portion of assertion metadata. It can choose which, if any, fields it wishes to consume, perhaps even varying based on the assertion type to which it is applied.

Below shows the core schemas used inside other assertions.

The [CDDL Definition](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610) for the assertion-metadata-map rule is found in [CDDL for Assertion Metadata](#page-142-1):

#### <span id="page-142-1"></span>CDDL for Assertion Metadata

An example in CBOR diagnostic notation [\(RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), clause 8):

```
{
  "reference": {
  "url": "self#jumbf=c2pa.assertions/c2pa.metadata",
  "alg": "sha256",
  "hash": b64'hoOspQQ1lFTy/4Tp8Epx670E5QW5NwkNR+2b30KFXug='
  },
  "dataSource": {
  "type": "localProvider.REE",
  "details": "EXIF GPS data provided by operating system geolocation API"
  }
}
```

In most cases, this assertion specific metadata will appear directly inside of other assertions (e.g., ingredients) as the value of their metadata field. However, sometimes it is necessary or desirable to store the assertion metadata in a separate, independent assertion metadata assertion, such as when an assertion is not in JSON or CBOR, such as thumbnails.

The label for the assertion metadata assertion is c2pa.assertion.metadata.

## **18.3.2. Data Source**

This dataSource field is an optional field that allows the claim generator to inform downstream Manifest Consumers about the source from which the assertion contents originated. If no dataSource is provided for a given assertion, the dataSource is considered to be the signer.

**NOTE**

By default, all created\_assertions are attributed to the signer, as the Trust Model is rooted in the trust of the signer, which is usually also the claim generator.

The value of the field is a dataSource object that is composed of two fields: type and details.

The dataSource type field defines the type of the dataSource. It is assembled with labels in the format described in [Section 6.2, "Labels"](#page-29-2). The value can be one of the following specification-defined values from [Table 5, "Data source](#page-144-0) [types",](#page-144-0) or [entity-specific namespaces](#page-29-4) can be used as an extension mechanism.

Table 5. Data source types

<span id="page-144-0"></span>

| Value of type               | Meaning                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| signer                      | The assertion contents came from the signer                                                                                                                      |
|                             | claimGenerator.REE Assertion contents came from a claim generator running in a rich execution environment<br>(REE), such as a desktop or mobile operating system |
|                             | claimGenerator.TEE Assertion contents came from a claim generator running in a trusted execution<br>environment (TEE), such as a trusted OS                      |
| localProvider.REE           | Assertion contents came from a data source running in an REE on the same physical<br>computing device as the claim generator                                     |
| localProvider.TEE           | Assertion contents came from a data source running in a TEE on the same physical<br>computing device as the claim generator                                      |
| remoteProvider              | Assertion contents came from a remote data source controlled by the signer or claim<br>generator vendor                                                          |
| remoteProvider.ext<br>ernal | Assertion contents came from an external, remote data source that is not the signer or<br>claim generator vendor                                                 |
| humanEntry                  | Assertion contents were entered by a human                                                                                                                       |

The details field is a human-readable string that provides additional information about the dataSource, e.g., the name of the API used to provide the assertion contents, or the URL of the server from which the contents were provided. For example, a broad location assertion source may have a type value of remoteProvider.3rdParty, with the details value set to www.googleapis.com/geolocation/v1/geolocate.

### **18.3.3. Review Ratings**

When present, the reviewRatings array provides a place for the claim generator to provide one or more rating objects on the quality (or lack thereof) of an assertion. A reviewRatings shall not be present if a dataSource object is present with a type field whose value is either humanEntry.anonymous or humanEntry.credentialed.

The value field of the rating object shall be present with any integer value from 1 (worst) through 5 (best). If present, the explanation field shall contain a human-consumable string description of the type of rating. In addition, an optional machine-readable code field which defines assertion-specific evaluation outcome codes may be provided. The value of the code field is defined using the same format described in [Section 6.2, "Labels"](#page-29-2). The value can be one of the following specification-defined values from [Table 6, "Values of](#page-145-0) [code](#page-145-0) [field",](#page-145-0) or [entity-specific](#page-29-4) [namespaces](#page-29-4) can be used as an extension mechanism.

Table 6. Values of code field

<span id="page-145-0"></span>

| Value of code                        | Applicable Assertion     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| actions.unknownAc<br>tionsPerformed  | c2pa.actions             | The actions assertion does not contain a full list of all actions<br>performed in the authoring tool (e.g., because of the use of a 3rd<br>party filter whose effect is unknown to the authoring tool). |
| actions.placedIng<br>redientNotFound | c2pa.actions             | The actions assertion being reviewed has a placed action<br>without a resolvable ingredient URI. value should be 1.                                                                                     |
| ingredient.action<br>Missing         | c2pa.ingredient          | The ingredient assertion being reviewed does not have at least<br>one action that references it in its claim. value should be 1.                                                                        |
| ingredient.notVis<br>ible            | c2pa.ingredient          | The ingredient assertion being reviewed is not visible in the<br>digital content bound to that manifest. value should be 1.                                                                             |
| depthMap.sceneMis<br>match           | c2pa.depthmap.GDe<br>pth | The contents of the depth map assertion do not correspond to<br>the scene portrayed in the primary presentation in the asset<br>(e.g., because of a picture-of-picture attack).                         |
| thumbnail.primary<br>Mismatch        | c2pa.thumbnail.cl<br>aim | The thumbnail's contents do not match the contents of the<br>primary presentation in the asset.                                                                                                         |

## **18.3.4. References**

Because the reference field of the assertion metadata assertion is a standard [hashed\\_uri,](#page-37-0) it is also possible to have an [assertion metadata assertion](#page-142-0) refer to assertions in other manifests than the active one. For example, the active manifest may include an assertion metadata assertion that validates the c2pa.metadata assertion present in an ingredient's manifest.

**NOTE**

Since the claim is a special type of assertion, this same method can be used to refer to claims in other manifests.

### **18.3.5. DateTime**

If a dateTime field is present, its value shall be a date time string that complies with CBOR date/times [\(RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), 3.4.1).

## <span id="page-146-2"></span>**18.3.6. Region of Interest**

The assertion may be specific to only a portion of an asset - such as a range of frames in a video or a specific area on an image. Such a portion may be identified using a regionOfInterest field, whose value is a region-map object (as defined in [Section 18.2, "Regions of Interest"](#page-133-2)).

## **18.3.7. Localization**

#### **18.3.7.1. General**

It is important that consumers of C2PA manifests be able to understand the information in their native language, when possible. To this end, it is possible to add localization information for an assertion with a dictionary that is included in the assertion's metadata.

#### <span id="page-146-1"></span>**18.3.7.2. Localization Dictionary**

A localization dictionary shall consist of a single object, where each of its keys represent the translations using the language indexing technique from [JSON-LD.](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#language-indexing) If the value that requires translation is not associated with a top-level key, then "dot notation" (.) shall be used to reference keys nested in objects. Array indexing notation ([n], n>=0) shall be used where a specific element in an array needs to be traversed. When the value requiring translation is itself an array, a specific element may be referenced. Some examples are shown in [Example 4, "Examples of Localization](#page-146-0) [Dictionaries"](#page-146-0):

<span id="page-146-0"></span>Example 4. Examples of Localization Dictionaries

```
{
  "dc:title": {
  "en-US": "Kevin's Five Cats",
  "en-GB": "Lord Kevin's Five Cats",
  "es-MX": "Los Cinco Gatos de Kevin",
  "es-ES": "Los Thinco Gatos de Kevin",

  "en-GB": "Joe's Photo Editor",
  "es": "Editor de fotos de Joe",
  "fr": "L'éditeur de photos de Joe",
  "jp": "ジョーの写真編集者"
  }
}
```

Any such 3rd party keys or values are required to be namespaced in the same way as [Section 6.2.1, "Namespacing"](#page-29-4), e.g. com.litware. In order for a Manifest Consumer to display human-readable information about these keys and values, the claim generator should provide the strings via this localization approach.

[Localized Actions](#page-147-1) shows its use in localizing custom [actions,](#page-193-0) by using it in the assertion metadata of a c2pa.actions assertion.

## <span id="page-148-0"></span>**18.5. Data Hash**

## **18.5.1. Description**

The most common way to uniquely verify the integrity of portions of a non-BMFF-based asset is via the hard bindings (i.e., cryptographic hash) present in data hash assertions. However, for those formats that are "box like" but not compatible with BMFF, the [general box hash](#page-164-0) assertion is recommended.

The alg field, if present, shall be a string that is one of the allowed hash algorithms as defined in [Section 13.1,](#page-67-1) ["Hashing"](#page-67-1), and that algorithm shall be used to compute the hash. If the alg field is not present, then the hashing algorithm shall be determined by the value of the alg field in the Claim. The hash value shall be present in the hash field.

Each data hash assertion defines a specified range of bytes over which the hash has been computed. If only a portion of the asset shall be hashed, then the range(s) to be excluded shall be present in the array value of the exclusions field. These excluded ranges shall be ordered by increasing start position and shall not overlap.

For data hash exclusion ranges, the range shall begin and end within the same logical unit (e.g., box, segment, object) and shall not overlap with any header or length field associated with that unit, except for freebox or pad data. It is the responsibility of the claim generator to define exclusion ranges in a way that ensures that whatever data an attacker might place in those ranges cannot materially affect the interpretation of the asset. Furthermore, the claim generator shall ensure the exclusion range only contains content from C2PA Manifest Store, or asset metadata (e.g., EXIF, IPTC metadata). Example metadata that could be skipped can be unverified user name or image rotation information.

A previous version of this specification provided a url field to provide a pointer to where the hashed data can be located, but it was never used. This field is now deprecated in favour of the [asset reference assertion](#page-226-0). Claim generators shall not add this field to a data hash assertion, and consumers shall ignore the field when present, except this shall not affect inclusion of the field as part of the content being validated as described in [Section 15.10.3,](#page-105-0) ["Assertion Validation".](#page-105-0)

A data hash assertion shall have a label of c2pa.hash.data.

A data hash assertion shall not appear in a [cloud data assertion](#page-188-0) or an [external reference assertion](#page-236-0).

A data hash assertion shall not be used with a [compressed manifest](#page-64-2).

**NOTE** This restriction exists to address a technical incompatibility between the two.

## **18.5.2. Schema and Example**

The schema for this type is defined by the data-hash-map rule in the following [CDDL Definition](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610):

```
; Also check optionality within the hash-map
; The data structure used to store the cryptographic hash of some or all of the asset's data
; and additional information required to compute the hash.
data-hash-map = {
  ? "exclusions": [1* EXCLUSION_RANGE-map], ; Ranges have monotonically increasing `start`
values, and no two ranges may overlap.
  ? "alg":tstr .size (1..max-tstr-length), ; A string identifying the cryptographic hash
algorithm used to compute the hash in this assertion, taken from the C2PA hash algorithm
identifier list. If this field is absent, the hash algorithm is taken the `alg` value of the
enclosing structure. If both are present, the field in this structure is used. If no value
is present in any of these places, this structure is invalid; there is no default.
  "hash": bstr, ; byte string of the hash value
  "pad": bstr, ; zero-filled byte string used for filling up space
  ? "pad2": bstr, ; zero-filled byte string used for filling up space
  ? "name": tstr .size (1..max-tstr-length), ; (optional) a human-readable description of
what this hash cover
  ? "url": uri, ; Unused and deprecated. 
}
EXCLUSION_RANGE-map = {
  "start": uint, ; Starting byte of the range
  "length": uint, ; Number of bytes of data to exclude
}
```

An example in CBOR diagnostic notation [\(RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), clause 8) is shown below:

```
{
  "alg" : "sha256",
  "pad" : '0000',
  "hash": 'Auxjtmax46cC2N3Y9aFmBO9Jfay8LEwJWzBUtZ0sUM8gA=',
  "name": "JUMBF manifest"
  "exclusions": [
```

```
  {
  "start": 9960,
  "length": 4213
  } 
  ],
}
```

Normally, the start and length values of an exclusion shall be written in their preferred serialization (i.e., "as short as possible"). However, when a data hash assertion needs to be created but the start and length values are not yet known, they shall be created "as large as possible", which would be as a 32-bit integer.

The pad value shall be present and shall be a zero-filled byte string. The pad2 value, if present, shall be a zero-filled byte string.

**NOTE**

[Section 10.4, "Multiple Step Processing"](#page-52-0) describes how to fill in the correct values and adjust the padding.

## **18.5.3. Special consideration for JPEG 1**

When hashing a JPEG 1 (.jpg) file into which the C2PA Manifest will be embedded, the APP11 marker (FFEB) and the segment's length (Lp) of all APP11 segments containing the JUMBF data shall be included in the exclusion range.

**NOTE**

All the APP11 segments containing the C2PA Manifest JUMBF are contiguous so that only a single range is required.

## **18.5.4. Special consideration for PNG**

When hashing a PNG (.png) file into which the C2PA Manifest will be embedded, it is important that the Length and the 'caBX' (representing the chunk type) of the chunk containing the JUMBF data be included in the exclusion range.

### **18.5.5. Special considerations for TIFF-based**

When hashing a TIFF-based asset into which the C2PA Manifest will be embedded, the count field of the C2PA Manifest Store's IFD Entry (representing the length of the JUMBF data) should be included in the exclusion ranges. This is to support Update Manifests, which could change the size of the embedded C2PA Manifest Store.

## <span id="page-150-0"></span>**18.6. BMFF-Based Hash**

### **18.6.1. Description**

Portion(s) of a BMFF-based asset that a claim generator wishes to uniquely identify with a hard binding (i.e., cryptographic hash) shall be described using BMFF-based hash assertions.

A BMFF-based hash assertion shall have a label of c2pa.hash.bmff.v3.

All Merkle trees used in BMFF-based hash assertions shall be balanced binary trees with the minimum depth necessary to accomodate leaf nodes, where NULL padding is applied only to the rightmost positions as needed to maintain the complete binary tree structure. This also requires that each level be more than half full, see [Section](#page-163-0) [18.6.6, "Validation".](#page-163-0)

**NOTE** Earlier versions of this specification also documented c2pa.hash.bmff and c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 assertions.

**IMPORTANT** Validators shall ignore any c2pa.hash.bmff assertions, processing the manifest as if the assertion were not present.

A BMFF-based hash assertion shall not appear in a [cloud data assertion](#page-188-0) nor an [external reference assertion](#page-236-0).

A previous version of this specification provided a url field to provide a pointer to where the hashed data can be located, but it was never used. This field is now deprecated in favour of the [asset reference assertion](#page-226-0). Claim generators shall not add this field to a BMFF hash assertion, and consumers shall ignore the field when present, except this shall not affect inclusion of the field as part of the content being validated as described in [Section 15.10.3,](#page-105-0) ["Assertion Validation".](#page-105-0)

## <span id="page-151-0"></span>**18.6.2. Hash Computation**

The alg field, if present, shall be a string that is one of the allowed hash algorithms as defined in [Section 13.1,](#page-67-1) ["Hashing"](#page-67-1), and that algorithm shall be used to compute the hash. If the alg field is not present, then the hashing algorithm shall be determined by the value of the alg field in the Claim.

To compute the hash specified in the value field of a BMFF hash, all bytes of the file are added to the hash excluding those BMFF boxes or subset[s] thereof which match any exclusion entry in the exclusions array.

Boxes that are included in their entirety also include their box headers in the input data contributed to the hash. Similarly, boxes that are excluded in their entirety also exclude their box headers from the input data contributed to the hash. When a box is partially excluded from the input data contributed to the hash through the use of a subset field in the exclusion specification, the portion(s) of the box to be excluded defined by the relative byte offsets in the subset field are offsets from the start of the box including the box headers, not offsets from the start of the box's content. These subset ranges shall be ordered by increasing offset value and shall not overlap.

In a c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 (deprecated) and c2pa.hash.bmff.v3 assertion, for any root box not excluded in its entirety, the input data contributed to the hash for that box is comprised of the concatenation of the binary strings offset || data, where offset is defined as the absolute file offset of the box as an 8-byte integer in big-endian format, and data is defined as the box's contents, including headers, minus any exclusions. In this definition, "||" represents the binary concatenation of the two. The offset shall not be included for Merkle tree hashes when the bmffhash-map includes both the hash and merkle fields.

In addition, c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 (deprecated) and c2pa.hash.bmff.v3 assertions include the following features:

- The absolute file byte offset is included at the start of the input data contributed to the hash for any root box. This ensures that a root box included in the hash cannot change positions in the file.
- The mdat box is no longer excluded in its entirety when the bmff-hash-map includes both the hash and merkle fields. Instead, a mandatory entry on the exclusion list excludes most of the box.

**NOTE**

These two features ensure that the mdat cannot change positions in the file while also eliminating the need for the offset for each individual Merkle tree hash when the bmff-hash-map includes both the hash and merkle fields.

A box matches an exclusion entry in the exclusions array if and only if all of the following conditions are met:

- The box's location in the file matches the exclusions-map entry's xpath field. For example, exclusion xpath /foo/bar[2] would match locations /foo[3]/bar[2] and /foo[2]/bar[2], but not /foo[3]/bar[1] or /foo[3]/bar[2]/baz[1].
- If length is specified in the exclusions-map entry, the box's length exactly matches the exclusions-map entry's length field. Note: The length includes the box headers.
- If version is specified in the exclusions-map entry, the box is a FullBox and the box's version exactly matches the exclusions-map entry's version field.
- If flags (byte array of exactly 3 bytes) is specified in the exclusions-map entry and the box is a FullBox. If exact is set to true or not specified, the box's flags (bit(24), i.e., 3 bytes) also exactly matches the exclusionsmap entry's flags field. If exact is set to false, the bitwise-and of the box's flags (bit(24), i.e., 3 bytes) with the exclusions-map entry's flags field exactly matches the exclusions-map entry's flags field (i.e., the box has at least those bits set but may also have additional bits set).
- If data (array of objects) is specified in the exclusions-map entry, then for each item in the array, the box's binary data at that item's relative byte offset field exactly matches that item's bytes field.

The xpath field's string syntax shall be limited to the following strict subset.

- Only abbreviated syntax shall be used.
- Only full paths shall be used.
- Only node selection via node or node[integer] shall be used.
- Descendent syntax, i.e., //, shall NOT be used.
- All nodes shall be BMFF 4cc codes.

#### Example 5. Complete Syntax for xpath Field

```
  xpath = '/' nodes
  nodes = node
  | node '/' nodes
  node = box4cc
  | box4cc '[' integer ']'
Where:
  box4cc is any 4cc allowed by ISO/IEC 14496-12 for a BMFF box.
```

integer is any non-zero positive integer with no leading zeros.

Any given exclusion entry may match zero or more boxes. It is not required that an exclusion entry match exactly one box.

A non-leaf xpath node shall only point to a container box that has no fields of its own (i.e., contains no data, only child boxes) and that does not inherit from FullBox. This ensures that a C2PA validator does not need to be aware of the syntax and semantics of unusual boxes that contain other boxes. If a child box of such an unusual box needs to be excluded in full or in part, the exclusions-map entry's xpath field shall point to the unusual box itself and the subset-map field shall exclude the byte range(s) containing the excluded child box data. For example, the 'sgpd' box contains other boxes but is unusual in that it inherits from FullBox; as such, if excluding child box(es), in whole or in part, from 'sgpd' is required, the assertion shall use an xpath field pointing to the 'sgpd' itself (e.g., /moof/traf/sgpd) and shall use the subset-map field to exclude the desired bytes.

If the C2PA Manifest is embedded into the file, the box containing it shall be one of the entries in the exclusions array. Refer to [Section A.5, "Embedding manifests into BMFF-based assets"](#page-259-0) for more information.

If a non-root excluded box is removed after the C2PA Manifest is created it shall be replaced with a 'free' box of the same size to ensure that the input data contributed to the hash for other boxes are not invalidated. If C2PA Manifest store size is reduced by using compressed manifest after the C2PA Manifest is created, a 'free' box shall be inserted in its place to ensure the offsets remain the same. If it is expected that a non-root excluded box may be added after the C2PA Manifest is created, then at manifest creation time, a 'free' box shall be inserted with sufficient space for the excluded box and that 'free' box shall also be excluded by an exclusion entry using its full xpath. When the excluded box is added or the C2PA Manifest store size is increased, the 'free' box shall be shrunk (or removed) to compensate for the added data. However if there is insufficient space in the 'free' box, a standard manifest shall be used.

Embedding C2PA data into a BMFF-based asset via MP4 boxes changes file offsets in other MP4 boxes as well as the absolute file byte offsets being included in the input data contributed to the hash for any root box. Those boxes and offsets shall be included in the input data contributed to the hash with their post-embed values, not their pre-embed values, or the BMFF-based hash assertion will not validate.

There are three possible ways an implementation can ensure that post-embed values for all file byte offsets are hashed:

- 1. Use 'free' boxes.
  - a. Determine reasonable maximum size(s) for the C2PA box(es) which will be embedded. All MP4 boxes for C2PA support unused padding bytes at the end, so it is fine to overestimate the size for the 'free' boxes because any extra bytes will be ignored.
  - b. Insert 'free' box(es) of said size(s) into the asset file(s) and update all offsets appropriately.
  - c. Perform hashing of the asset with "/free" on the exclusion list.
  - d. Create and sign the manifest. Create the C2PA box(es).

- e. Overwrite the 'free' box(es) with the C2PA box(es).
- 2. Use a two-pass approach.
  - a. Compute the exact sizes of the BMFF-based hash assertion and the merkle box(es) if any. The latter will require parsing the asset file(s) to determine the size of the Merkle tree.
  - b. Compute the exact size of the final manifest.
  - c. Perform hashing of the asset file(s). Update any box that includes any file offsets to correct values before including that box in the input data contributed to the hash. Compute the input data contributed to the hash using (offset || data) using the updated absolute file offset as described above. As indicated above, the offset is not included in the data contributed for Merkle tree hashes when the bmff-hash-map includes both the hash and merkle fields.
  - d. Create and sign the manifest. Create the C2PA box(es).
  - e. Insert the C2PA box(es).
- 3. Place updated Manifest Store at end of BMFF file.
  - a. Set original manifest store box\_purpose from manifest to original.
  - b. Create and sign the manifest.
  - c. Create [C2PA ContentProvenanceBox](#page-259-0) with box\_purpose set to update.
  - d. Insert updatedManifest into [C2PA ContentProvenanceBox](#page-259-0).
  - e. Insert the [C2PA ContentProvenanceBox](#page-259-0) at end of BMFF file.
  - f. If a standard manifest is added when an update manifest store is present, the update manifest store contents are moved to the 'original' manifest.
  - g. The updated manifest store is then removed from the end of the file, allowing backward compatibility with a single manifest for common use-cases.
  - h. The 'original' manifest store box\_purpose is changed back to manifest and the standard manifest is added as normal.

**NOTE**

The box\_purpose field is not included within the hash and can change without invalidating any existing hash. Likewise, appending the new [C2PA ContentProvenanceBox](#page-259-0) is not invalidating existing hashes.

While the two-pass approach method is significantly more complex, it does enable correct hashing without any foreknowledge of the maximum manifest size. It also minimizes the final asset's size. Common boxes (**not** exhaustive) with file offsets include 'iloc', 'stco', 'co64', 'tfhd', 'sidx', and 'saio'.

The option of placing updated Manifests at the end of the BMFF file allows updates when there is not a large enough 'free' box or when the two-pass approach complexity is not desired. This option also supports chunk offsets in atom 'stco' boxes with partial data offset information.

## **18.6.3. Schema and Example**

The schema for the c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 (deprecated) and c2pa.hash.bmff.v3 assertions are defined by the bmff-hash-map rule in the following [CDDL Definition:](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610)

This section describes a set of pre-defined, named, profiles of extensions lists.

#### **18.6.4.2. Basic profile**

Typical untimed media (e.g., still photos) and timed media (e.g., videos with or without audio tracks, whether fragmented or not) need only include the mandatory exclusions listed in [Exclusion List Requirements.](#page-265-0)

Figure 15. Fragmented BMFF Entity Diagram

#### <span id="page-163-0"></span>18.6.6. Validation

Validating a given chunk requires first validating the merkle-map field's initHash over the corresponding initialization segment and then locating the correct entry in the merkle-map field's hashes array and validating it against the hash of the chunk's data, and if needed, deriving that hash using the Merkle proof from the hashes specified in the chunk's bmff-merkle-map.

![](_page_163_Figure_2.jpeg)

Figure 16. Validating intitialization segment and a chunk's data example

To verify track chunk **m+3** you must first verify the corresponding initialization segment. The c2pa-specific manifest box in each Track's initialization segment will contain the Manifest store. If the asset contains multiple initialization segments then the Manifest store must be identical in each. This allows validators to verify a Track belong to the larger set. The active manifest's c2pa.bmff.hash assertion will contain a merkle field with an array of merklemap objects, one per track.

#### 18.6.6.1. Steps

- 1. From the bmff-merkle-map in chunk's c2pa-specific merkle box obtain the uniqueld & localld. Use the uniqueld and localld to find a matching merkle-map from the c2pa.bmff.hash assertion merkle array in the init segment.
- 2. If the hash of the init segment using the c2pa.bmff.hash exclusions and the merkle-map alg equals the initHash inside the merkle-map you just located, the initialization segment is verified.

NOTE

The parameters alg & hash at the top level of the bmff-hash-map are used for monolithic MP4, whereas alg & hashes in the merkle-map are used for fragmented MP4.

To complete verification of chunk **m+3**: We are looking at Track #n's merkle-map found in step 1, and in this example it contains row 2 of the Merkle tree - **D2,0** and **D2,1**.

- 3. Hash chunk **m+3** using the c2pa.hash.bmff exclusions array and the alg from the merkle-map, yielding **D0,2(derived)**.
- 4. Chunk **m+3**'s bmff-merkle-map hashes array (Merkle proof) will contain the hash of chunk m+4 **(D0,3)** and row one hash value **D1,0**.
- 5. Hash **D0,2(derived)** and **D0,3** to yield **D1,1(derived)**. Hash **D1,0** with **D1,1(derived)** to yield **D2,0(derived)**.
- 6. If **D2,0(derived)** = **D2,0** as stored in the assertion merkle-map hashes parameter, and the corresponding initialization segment was verified in step 2, then chunk m+3 has been verified.

## <span id="page-164-0"></span>**18.7. General Box Hash**

## **18.7.1. Description**

A claim generator should use a general box hash assertion to verify the integrity, with a hard binding (i.e., cryptographic hash), of assets whose formats use a non-BMFF-based box format such as JPEG, PNG, or GIF.

A general box hash assertion shall have a label of c2pa.hash.boxes. Such an assertion consists of an array of structures, each one listing one or more boxes (by their name/identifier) and a hash that covers that data of those boxes (and any possible data that may be present in the file between them), along with the algorithm used for hashing. The boxes shall appear in the assertion in the same order that they appear in the asset, including the box containing the C2PA Manifest. If there are any other boxes present in the asset that are not explicitly included in this assertion, or if the boxes appear out of order, the manifest will be rejected during validation as described in [Section](#page-123-0) [15.12.3, "Validating a general box hash".](#page-123-0)

A box may also have an excluded field, which is a boolean value indicating whether a validator can ignore this box (and associated hash) during validation. If this field is absent, or the field is present and its value is false, the box shall be hashed and the values compared. For boxes that have an excluded field with a value of true, the claim generator should include an accurate hash for compatibility with older validators that do not recognize the excluded field. If the claim generator is not concerned with backwards compatibility, it should write the binary string 00 (a single byte with a value of 0) for the hash.

A box may also include an exclusions field, which is an array of byte ranges to be excluded from the hash calculation. Each exclusion range shall be a map with start and length fields, indicating the byte offset (from the start of the box) and number of bytes to exclude. When multiple boxes exist in a box-hash-map structure, it is necessary to specify which box an exclusion range belongs to by using a boxIndex field. The first boxIndex in the box-hash-map structure is 0, 1 for the next, and so on. These ranges shall be ordered by increasing start offset and shall not overlap.

For box hash exclusion ranges, the range shall begin and end within one box and shall not overlap with any header or length field associated with that box, except for freebox or pad data. It is the responsibility of the claim generator to define exclusion ranges in a way that ensures that whatever data an attacker might place in those ranges cannot materially affect the interpretation of the asset. Furthermore, the claim generator shall ensure the exclusion range only contains content from C2PA Manifest Store, or asset metadata (e.g., EXIF, IPTC metadata). Example metadata that could be skipped can be unverified user name or image rotation information.

The excluded and exclusions fields serve different purposes. excluded is a boolean flag indicating that the entire box may be ignored during validation. exclusions is a list of byte ranges within the box that should be excluded from the hash calculation. If both fields are present, the excluded field is set to true takes precedence and the exclusions field shall be ignored. When the excluded field is set to false or the excluded field is absent, the exclusions field shall be applied.

In the case where there are multiple instances of the same box type, such as multiple APP1 segments in a JPEG 1 file, each instance shall be listed separately in the assertion. JPEG segments that are fragments sharing the same segment identifier are also listed as separate boxes, with the exception of the segments comprising the C2PA Manifest Store (as described below).

The alg field in box-hash-map, if present, shall be a string that is one of the allowed hash algorithms as defined in [Section 13.1, "Hashing",](#page-67-1) and that algorithm shall be used to compute the hash. If the alg field is not present in boxhash-map, then the hashing algorithm shall be determined by the value of the alg field in the containing box-map, or if that is not present, by the value of the alg field in the Claim.

The creation of the hashes is described in [Section 13.1, "Hashing",](#page-67-1) and the value shall be present in the hash field. The hash value for a range of boxes shall be computed from the start of the first box (in the range) until the end of the last box (in the range). This would include any arbitrary bytes that may be present between boxes.

**NOTE**

When using a range of boxes, all data between the start of the first box and the end of the last box is included in the hash. However, when listing each box separately, additional data is not included, only data within the listed box.

The box containing the C2PA Manifest Store (e.g. caBX for PNG, or 21FF for GIF) shall also be listed in its own array. In order to clearly identify it as the C2PA Manifest box, it shall have the name C2PA and the value of hash shall be the binary string 00 (a single byte with a value of 0). The C2PA Manifest Store shall be represented as a single box, even in the case of a JPEG file where the box is fragmented across multiple APP11 marker segments.

**NOTE**

As validators are often used in combination with output of file parsers, it is a security best practice to hash all of the file content outside of the C2PA Manifest Store. This will ensure the integrity of the media and the linked manifest.

The optional pad and pad2 values, if present, shall be zero-filled byte strings.

**NOTE**

[Section 10.4, "Multiple Step Processing"](#page-52-0) describes how to fill in the correct values and adjust the padding.

A General Box Hash assertion shall not appear in a [Cloud Data assertion](#page-188-0) or a [External Reference assertion](#page-236-0).

## **18.7.2. Special handling of multi-part assets**

To support file formats that consist of multiple parts (as described in [Section 18.9, "Multi-Asset Hash"\)](#page-176-0), one additional logical box is defined for cases where the data of one or more parts comes after the box-based data of the primary part. This box shall be labelled c2pa.after (for arbitrary data beyond the end of the box structure). The c2pa.after box, if present, shall be the last box listed, and its hash shall be computed from the byte following the last box until the end of the physical file.

The hard binding assertion, which covers the whole asset, shall be the only assertion that can include a c2pa.after box. A hash assertion for an individual part shall cover only the contents of that part itself, and not any other part.

### <span id="page-166-0"></span>**18.7.3. Handling for specific formats**

#### **18.7.3.1. JPEG-specific Handling**

When working with JPEG, the APP11 box is used for standards other than C2PA (i.e., JPEG 360). In those situations, all non-C2PA APP11 boxes shall be included in the list of hashed boxes. The APP11 boxes containing the C2PA Manifest Store shall be identified by C2PA. All other boxes shall be identified by the symbol found in [ISO 10918-1:1994, Table](https://www.iso.org/standard/18902.html) [B.1](https://www.iso.org/standard/18902.html).

The C2PA Manifest Store can be identified by it being a JUMBF superbox with a label of c2pa and a JUMBF type UUID of 63327061-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 as described in [Section 11.1.4.2, "Manifest Store".](#page-58-2)

**NOTE**

The Start of Scan box and Restart boxes, label of SOS and RST[n], will include the entropy coded segments following the respective marker.

The [Multi-Picture Format \(MPF\)](https://www.cipa.jp/e/std/std-sec.html) extension to JPEG can also be supported using this method by listing all boxes contained in the file as they appear, assuming there is no data between the EOI of one Individual Image and the SOI of the next. The boxes list would enumerate the segments from each Individual Image in the MPF in sequence (SOI, …, EOI, SOI, …, EOI, …). However, if the claim generator plans to treat the MPF file as a multi-part asset, then the c2pa.after box shall be used to hash the additional parts that follow the EOI of the first Individual Image (the primary part).

#### **18.7.3.2. PNG-specific Handling**

A PNG file always begins with an 8 byte header (89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A). To include it, use the special value PNGh as the first box in the list of boxes and start hashing from the first byte of the image.

#### **18.7.3.3. TIFF-specific Handling**

**NOTE**

Previous versions of this specification documented use of general box hash with TIFF. However, the use of indirection and other characteristics of the TIFF structure make box hashing awkward, inefficient, and prone to interoperability issues, so it has been decided to remove the general box hash support for TIFF, in favor of the data hash.

#### **18.7.3.4. GIF-specific Handling**

The hash of a box containing a 'Packed Fields' attribute will also hash the optional data indicated by that attribute. For example, The Image Descriptor will include the Local Color Table block, and the Logical Screen Descriptor will include the Global Color Table block, if they exist.

For all boxes containing a block label, the naming convention shall be as follows: "<Block Label>".

For all extension blocks, the naming convention is as follows: "<Extension Introducer><Extension Label>".

The only other blocks that are not described by the above naming convention are:

- The header will be marked with "GIF89a".
- The Table Based Image Data will be marked with "TBID".
- The Logical Screen Descriptor will be marked with "LSD".

#### For example:

• Header: "GIF89a".

• Trailer: "3B".

• Image Descriptor: "2C".

• Comment Extension: "21FE".

#### **18.7.3.5. RIFF-specific Handling**

RIFF file chunks may be nested in a tree structure of arbitrary depth. The root of this structure consists of one or more **L0** chunks, each with the chunk identifier of RIFF. These RIFF chunks are defined with the following structure:

- Bytes 0-3: Chunk identifier, always RIFF.
- Bytes 4-7: Chunk length (minus 8 bytes for the chunk identifier and chunk length fields).
- Bytes 8-11: Media type identifier.
- Bytes 12-n: Chunk data (all **L1** chunks).

After the media type identifier, the RIFF chunk may contain one or more **L1** sub-chunks, each with the following structure:

- Bytes 0-3: Chunk identifier.
- Bytes 4-7: Chunk length (minus 8 bytes for the chunk identifier and chunk length fields).
- Bytes 8-n: Chunk data.
- Byte n+1: Padding byte (if necessary).

A special chunk identifier of LIST may be used to nest chunks within an **L1** chunk. These LIST chunks mimic the

#### structure of **L0** RIFF chunks:

- Bytes 0-3: Chunk identifier, always LIST.
- Bytes 4-7: Chunk length (minus 8 bytes for the chunk identifier and chunk length fields).
- Bytes 8-11: List type identifier.
- Bytes 12-n: Chunk data (all **L2** chunks).
- Byte n+1: Padding byte (if necessary).

For the purposes of calculating a general box hash, each **L0** chunk shall be treated as a single box with a size of exactly 12 bytes, and a box name equal to the media type identifier (bytes 8-11). Each non-LIST **L1** chunk shall be treated as a box with a name equal to the chunk identifier (bytes 0-3) and content extending from the beginning of the chunk identifier (byte 0) to the padding byte, if any, inclusive. Each LIST **L1** chunk shall be treated as a box with a name equal to the list type identifier (bytes 8-11) and content extending from the beginning of the chunk identifier (byte 0) to the padding byte, if any, inclusive. All chunks nested within a LIST **L1** chunk (**L2** and higher) shall be treated as a part of the LIST **L1** chunk's content and hashed as a single box.

In all cases, padding bytes shall be treated as part of the preceding chunk's content, and shall be included in the hash for that box.

#### **18.7.3.6. Font-specific Handling**

The tables of a font correspond directly to the hash boxes, including the C2PA table.

Tables are always enumerated in the order they appear in the font's table directory.

Note that the table directory itself is not part of the hashed content, and therefore not covered by any box.

The checkSumAdjustment value shall be treated as zero (0) when computing the hash for the box containing the head table.

The grouping, or lack thereof, of Font tables in the general box hash assertion is up to the claim generator.

Note: Fonts created for wide distribution may benefit from assigning each table to an individual box; in this way, if the font is re-packaged in another format, its hash will continue to validate correctly. By contrast, systems which generate large numbers of fonts automatically, such as a subsetter, may choose to combine tables into fewer boxes to streamline processing. In this case, the box hash(es) may not validate following a format transformation, due to the inclusion of inter-table padding.

Because font consumers shall not react to tables they do not recognize, existing font-handling infrastructure will expect that the head table's checkSumAdjustment value incorporate the final settled content of the C2PA table itself, including any local manifest in its entirety.

#### **18.7.3.7. Ogg-specific Handling**

In an Ogg file, the structure consists of one or more logical bitstreams, and the data for each stream is held in Ogg Pages. For the purpose of hashing, each logical bitstream is treated as a single 'box', which includes every Page, in order, with the same bitstream\_serial\_number. The C2PA Manifest Store 'box' is the logical bitstream identified in [Section A.3.5, "Embedding manifests into OGG Vorbis"](#page-254-0).

The box-name for each non-C2PA logical bitstream shall be a string constructed in the format: Stream- [bitstream\_serial\_number].

The bitstream\_serial\_number in the box name shall be the ASCII-encoded base-10 value of the 4-byte number for that stream, read as a 32-bit little-endian unsigned integer, found in its Ogg Page headers. For example, a logical bitstream with the bitstream\_serial\_number \x01\x00\x00\x00 will have the box-name "Stream-1".

## **18.7.4. Schema and Example**

Normally, the start and length values of an exclusion shall be written in their preferred serialization (i.e., "as short as possible"). However, when a box hash assertion needs to be created but the start and length values are not yet known, they shall be created "as large as possible", which would be as a 32-bit integer.

## <span id="page-173-0"></span>**18.8. Collection Data Hash**

## **18.8.1. Description**

In workflows where it is known in advance that the C2PA Manifest will refer to a collection of assets, instead of a single asset, the collection data hash assertion shall be used as the method to specify the hard bindings (i.e., cryptographic hashes) for the assets in the collection.

**NOTE**

It is possible to describe each folder of the training data set of an AI/ML model by having each folder be a separate ingredient of the complete training data set's manifest.

A collection data hash assertion shall have a label of c2pa.hash.collection.data.

A collection data hash assertion shall not appear in a [cloud data assertion.](#page-188-0)

## **18.8.2. Schema and Example**

The schema for this type is defined by the collection-data-hash-map rule in the following [CDDL Definition:](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610)

```
; An array of URIs and their associated hashes
$collection-data-hash-map /= {
  "uris": [1* uri-hashed-data-map],
  "alg": tstr .size (1..max-tstr-length), ; A string identifying the cryptographic hash
algorithm used to compute the hash on each entry of the `uris` array, taken from the C2PA

  ? "dc:format": format-string, ; IANA media type of the data
  ? "data_types": [1* $asset-type-map], ; additional information about the data's type
```

```
}
; with CBOR Head (#) and tail ($) are introduced in regexp, so not needed explicitly

  },
  ]
}
```

## **18.8.3. Fields**

The uris field consists of an array of uri-hashed-data-map values that represents a collection of assets. The alg field, if present, shall be a string that is one of the allowed hash algorithms as defined in [Section 13.1, "Hashing"](#page-67-1), and that algorithm shall be used to compute the hash of each member of the collection. If the alg field is not present, then the hashing algorithm shall be determined by the value of the alg field in the Claim.

For each uri-hashed-data-map, the uri field shall be present and shall be a valid relative URI. All URIs shall be considered as relative to the location of the manifest, regardless of whether that is local, in a container (e.g., ZIP) or in the cloud. As a relative URI can contain navigation elements (e.g., ../), it is possible to refer to content items that are not in the same folder as the manifest - which would be a security issue. A claim generator shall validate or sanitize the URIs before use, ensuring that neither . nor .. appear as part of the URI.

The hash field is a byte string representing of the valid hash value for the content item, as determined by the alg field. The hash shall be over all bytes (from 0 to n) of the content item - no exceptions.

The rest of the fields are identical to those of an [ingredient assertion.](#page-209-0)

## **18.8.4. Hashing the members of the collection**

Each file in the collection shall be hashed individually using the specific hash algorithm defined in the alg field. The resultant hash value shall be stored in the hash field of the uri-hashed-data-map associated with the uri to the file.

Not all files in a given hierarchy are required to be included in a hashed collection.

**NOTE**

While this is useful in cases where there are files present that aren't necessary to hash, it also provides an opening for an adversary to add files without invalidating the binding.

## <span id="page-176-0"></span>**18.9. Multi-Asset Hash**

## **18.9.1. Description**

There exist a number of file formats that are composed of multiple parts, where each part is itself a valid file format, such as when multiple individual images are aggregated into a single file. Some examples include:

- CIPA [Multi-Picture](https://www.cipa.jp/std/documents/download_e.html?CIPA_DC-007-2025_E) Format (MPF)
- Android [Ultra HDR](https://developer.android.com/media/platform/hdr-image-format) format (which uses MPF)
- [ISO 21496](https://www.iso.org/standard/86775.html) HDR (which uses MPF)
- [Android Motion Photo](https://developer.android.com/media/platform/motion-photo-format) format (which doesn't use MPF, but can exist alongside MPF in the same file)

In some cases, it may be desirable or even required to verify the integrity of each individual part of the file, rather than just the file as a whole. Accordingly, the current set of hard binding assertions are not sufficient to separately verify the integrity of each part. Additionally, the individual parts may have their own C2PA Manifests that need to be recorded. The multi-asset hash assertion is used to provide this functionality.

One additional unique case is where an individual part is optional - meaning that it is possible that it can/will be removed as part of a workflow that does not involve a trusted signer - but the ability to verify the integrity of the rest of the file is still desired.

## **18.9.2. Details**

A multi-asset hash assertion shall have a label of c2pa.hash.multi-asset. Although it contains hashes and modifies the handling of the hard binding, it is not considered a hard binding.

A multi-asset hash assertion shall not appear in a [cloud data assertion](#page-188-0) nor an [external reference assertion](#page-236-0).

A multi-asset hash assertion should not be used with a [compressed manifest](#page-64-2).

**NOTE**

It is not clear if there exists a technical incompatibility between the two, so it is recommended to avoid using them together until further evaluation is complete.

Each part, including the primary part, shall be represented as a part-hash-map object within the parts array. The location field shall contain a locator object that describes the location of the part within the file. The locator object shall contain either a bmffBox field or byteOffset and length fields. The byteOffset field shall contain the byte offset (from the physical start of the file) of the part within the file, and the length shall contain the length of the part in bytes. The bmffBox field shall contain the BMFF box of the part, when the part is contained with the primary part but as a specific BMFF box (e.g., mpvd as used by Motion Photo). For a part described by a bmffBox field, the content of the part shall be considered the payload of that box only, excluding the box header.

The parts within the parts array shall be listed in the order in which they appear in the file, and the parts shall be contiguous, non-overlapping, and cover every byte of the asset.

**NOTE**

Appearance in the file is defined as their sequential order as they would be located if starting from byte 0 and scanning through to the last byte of the file.

The hashAssertion field shall contain a hashed URI to the hash assertion for the part. A part's hash assertion shall be a standard hard binding assertion (e.g., c2pa.hash.data), but the label shall have the string .part and any [multiple instance identifier](#page-30-1) appended. For example, c2pa.hash.data.part\_\_2. Any uses of absolute byte offsets in a part's hash assertion (e.g., the start value in a data hash exclusion range) shall be computed relative to the beginning of that part.

**NOTE**

Adding these label suffixes makes it clear that hard binding assertions for parts are not considered standard hard binding assertions and thus there can exist multiple instances of them within a C2PA Manifest.

The optional field shall be a boolean indicating if the presence of the part is optional - the default is false if not present.

If a part has its own C2PA Manifest, which is not self-contained within that part (e.g., individual frames in a multiframe asset), then it is recommended to store that C2PA Manifest into the asset's Manifest Store and create a componentOf ingredient to reference it.

### **18.9.3. Schema and Example**

The schema for this type is defined by the multi-asset-hash-map rule in the following [CDDL Definition](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610):

```
multi-asset-hash-map = {
  "parts": [* part-hash-map] ; An array of one or more hashes for individual parts of the
multi-part file
}
byte-range-locator = (
  "byteOffset": uint ; The byte offset of the part within the file
  "length": uint ; The length of the part
)
; this is a special CDDL map of choices (meaning that only one of the following can be
present)
; The byte offset & length of the part within the file
; An XPath to the BMFF box of the part
locator-map = {
  (byte-range-locator // "bmffBox": tstr)
}
part-hash-map = {
  "location" : locator-map, ; The location of the part within the file
  "hashAssertion": $hashed-uri-map, ; hashed_uri to the hash assertion of the part
  ? "optional": bool, ; If the part is optional and can be discarded
}
```

An example in CBOR diagnostic notation [\(RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), clause 8) is shown below:

## <span id="page-180-0"></span>**18.10. Soft Binding**

## **18.10.1. Description**

If a claim generator will be providing a soft binding for the asset's content, it shall be described using a soft binding assertion. The types of soft bindings which may be created and stored in such an assertion are described in [Section](#page-180-0) [18.10, "Soft Binding"](#page-180-0).

A previous version of this specification provided a url field to provide a pointer to where the hashed data may be

located, but it was never used. This field is now deprecated in favor of the [asset reference assertion.](#page-226-0) Claim generators shall not add this field to a soft binding assertion, and consumers shall ignore the field when present, except this shall not affect inclusion of the field as part of the content being validated as described in [Section 15.10.3, "Assertion](#page-105-0) [Validation"](#page-105-0).

A previous version of this specification provided an extent field within the scope field to describe a portion of the digital content covered by the soft binding assertion, in an algorithm specific format. This field is now deprecated in favor of the region field. Claim generators shall not add this field to a soft binding assertion, and consumers should ignore the field when present. This does not affect inclusion of the field as part of the content being validated as described in [Section 15.10.3, "Assertion Validation".](#page-105-0)

A soft binding assertion shall have a label of c2pa.soft-binding.

## **18.10.2. Schema and Example**

```

An example in CBOR diagnostic notation [\(RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), clause 8) is shown below:

  "value": b64'ZG1Gc2RXVXlDZz09=='
  }
  ]
}
```

## **18.10.3. Requirements**

The soft binding algorithm used shall be present as the value of the alg field, and the blocks over which is was applied shall be listed in the blocks field. If the algorithm used requires any additional parameters, they should be present as the value of alg-params.

The scope field may contain either a region or timespan field to describe the portion of digital content that the soft binding has been computed over. The region field, when present, contains a region-map object (as defined in [Section 18.2, "Regions of Interest"](#page-133-2)). The timespan field, when present, describes the time interval over which the soft binding was computed in milliseconds from the start of the content.

The optional pad and pad2 values, if present, shall be zero-filled byte strings.

#### **18.10.3.1. bindingMetadata**

A soft binding assertion may include a bindingMetadata key that provides for the specification of some algorithm or workflow-specific information via some pre-defined as well as custom fields (and their associated values). Custom fields shall conform to the same syntax as [entity-specific namespacing](#page-29-4), e.g. com.litware.someFieldName.

**NOTE**

This is useful for providing extra information that would be useful to a specific workflow or C2PA Manifest Consumer.

A C2PA Validator should not use this information when validating the soft binding, but may use it for logging or informational purposes. The normative information for validating the soft binding is contained in the other fields of the soft binding assertion as well as the entry for the algorithm in the [Soft Binding Algorithm List](#page-183-0).

## <span id="page-183-0"></span>**18.10.4. Soft Binding Algorithm List**

The soft binding algorithm list is a machine readable list of permissible values for the alg field. The alg field shall correspond to the alg field of an algorithm present in that list. The format of alg-params and value fields are algorithm specific and described via a human readable information page referenced by informationalUrl within the entry for alg in the list.

The list is maintained as a JSON document by the C2PA at the following location: [https://github.com/c2pa-org/](https://github.com/c2pa-org/softbinding-algorithm-list) [softbinding-algorithm-list](https://github.com/c2pa-org/softbinding-algorithm-list)

Entries in the soft binding algorithm list that have a deprecated field of true shall be considered deprecated and shall not be used to create soft binding assertions in manifests. Soft binding algorithms marked deprecated may be used for resolving soft bindings but this behaviour is discouraged.

The JSON schema for entries within the soft binding algorithm list is shown below:

The unique name of the algorithm is given in the alg field, and corresponds to the string that shall be used in the alg field a soft binding assertion that uses that algorithm. The name shall follow the [namespacing](#page-29-4) requirements and represent the owner of the algorithm. A unique numeric identifier is also assigned for each algorithm. If different versions of an algorithm are provided, then each shall have a separate entry in the Soft Binding Algorithm List.

The type of the algorithm shall be either 'watermark' or 'fingerprint' to represent that the algorithm is an invisible watermark, or a fingerprint.

The deprecation status of the algorithm is given in the deprecated field. A validator should not resolve any soft bindings that use deprecated algorithms. C2PA Manifests shall not be written using deprecated soft bindings.

The soft binding algorithm list entry shall contain a list of supported media types either as encodedMediaTypes or as decodedMediaTypes. The supported media types for decodedMediaTypes shall correspond to one more of the top-level IANA media types comprising of: "application", "audio", "image", "model", "text", "video". The supported media types for encodedMediaTypes shall correspond to one more of the registered IANA subtypes of a decodedMediaType listed in the preceding sentence. These IANA top-level and subtypes are listed at <https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml>

Additional information shall accompany each entry in the soft binding algorithm list, within the entryMetadata field. These are a human readable description of the algorithm (description), and the date it was proposed for entry into the soft binding algorithm list (dateEntered).

The contact details of the owner of the entry shall be provided as an email address (contact, required). An informational URL (informationalUrl, required) shall be provided that references a human readable page describing characteristics of the soft binding algorithm. The information at that page is unconstrained but might include details such as how to interpret the value field in the soft binding registry, which is encoded in an algorithm specific form.

### **18.10.5. Soft Binding Resolution API**

The soft binding resolution API is a Web API providing a standard way of retrieving C2PA Manifest stores from a soft binding resolution API endpoint given a soft binding value, a manifest identifier, or an asset. The soft binding algorithm list entry may contain a list of URIs of soft binding resolution APIs in the softBindingResolutionApis field. If several URIs are given then any may be used for a soft binding resolution.

The API specification and documentation is available [here](softbinding:Decoupled.pdf#SBR-API).

#### **18.10.5.1. Validating Soft Binding Matches**

A common use for soft bindings is to discover the active manifest, from a manifest repository, for an asset whose C2PA Manifest is absent or invalid.

Discovery of the C2PA Manifest shall be performed using one, or a combination of, algorithms identified by the alg field within the C2PA Soft Binding Algorithm List. The list is maintained as a JSON document by the C2PA at the following location:<https://github.com/c2pa-org/softbinding-algorithm-list>

If a C2PA Manifest is found in a manifest repository, and that manifest contains one or more soft binding assertions,

then the matcher shall ensure that all soft binding assertions in the located manifest match the soft bindings used to perform the discovery.

A soft binding assertion shall be considered a match if both the algorithm identifier (alg) and the value (value) described within the assertion match the algorithm identifier (alg) and value (value) used to perform the match. Matching is performed in the manner prescribed by the specified algorithm.

## <span id="page-188-0"></span>**18.11. Cloud Data**

## **18.11.1. Description**

There are use cases where storing the data for the assertion remotely, such as in the cloud, is better than embedded inside the asset, especially when the data is large. For any such cases, it is possible to use a special type of assertion that serves as a reference to that information. For privacy and reliability reasons, data referenced through a cloud data assertion shall be considered optional: their contents should not be retrieved as part of manifest validation. A validator may retrieve the contents later to serve an application-dependent need, such as further exploration of the provenance history. The remote data described by a Cloud Data assertion must be static, as its location is specified via a hashed URI. To reference unhashed data that may change over time, an [External Reference](#page-236-0) assertion may be used.

The original cloud data assertion allowed for pointing to arbitrary data in the cloud, in a variety of formats. However, this doesn't align with that actual data model used in C2PA, where assertions have a defined structure as a JUMBF box. Therefore, the cloud data assertion has been updated to clarify that it specifically points to an actual JUMBF box that is stored remotely. As such, the default IANA media type for the data referenced by a cloud data assertion, and stored in the content\_type field is application/jumbf.

**NOTE** IANA registration for application/jumbf is in progress.

If [assertion metadata](#page-142-0) is included as part of another assertion, then it too would be part of the information referenced from a cloud data assertion. It is also possible to store individual assertion metadata assertions remotely, just as with other assertion types.

A cloud data assertion shall have a label of c2pa.cloud-data.

A cloud data assertion shall not refer to an assertion with any of the following labels:

- c2pa.cloud-data
- c2pa.action (deprecated)
- c2pa.actions.v2
- c2pa.hash.data
- c2pa.hash.boxes
- c2pa.hash.collection.data
- c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 (deprecated)

- c2pa.hash.bmff.v3
- c2pa.hash.multi-asset

Since the cloud data assertion only contains a reference to externally hosted data, the size field shall contain the size of the data being referenced. Because that is required to be present, the optional size field in the hashed external URI map shall not be present. Similarly, since there is a content\_type field in the cloud data assertion itself, the optional dc:format field in the hashed external URI map shall not be present.

## **18.11.2. Schema and Example**

The schema for this type is defined by the cloud-data-map rule in the following [CDDL Definition:](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610)

```
; Assertion that references the actual assertion stored in the cloud
cloud-data-map = {
  "label": tstr, ; label for the cloud-based assertion (eg.c2pa.actions)
  "size": size-type, ; Number of bytes of data
  "location": $hashed-ext-uri-map, ; http(s) URL to where the cloud-hosted assertion can be
found
  ? "content_type": tstr .regexp "^[-\\w.]+/[-+\\w.]+$", ; media/MIME type for the data
  ? "metadata": $assertion-metadata-map, ; additional information about the assertion
}
; size is minimum 1 in multiples of 1.0
size-type = int .ge 1
```

An example in CBOR diagnostic notation [\(RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), clause 8) is shown below:

```
{
  "size": 4321,
  "label": "c2pa.metadata",
  "location": {
  "alg": "sha256",
  "url": "https://some.storage.us/foo",
  "hash": b64'zP84FPSremIrAQHlhw+hRYQdZp/+KggnD0W8opXlIQQ='
  },
}
```

## <span id="page-189-0"></span>**18.12. Embedded Data**

## **18.12.1. Description**

In previous versions of this specification, a concept of a data box as a special type of JUMBF box was used as a way to enable the arbitrary embedding of data into a C2PA Manifest, such as for thumbnails, icons and inputTo ingredients. It was determined that doing this via a new type of box introduced unnecessary complexities and missing functionality - such as the inability to redact data boxes. Accordingly, that concept has been deprecated in favor of a standard assertion which uses a standard JUMBF Embedded File content type box to contain the data.

An embedded data assertion shall have a label that starts with c2pa.embedded-data and follows the [rules of](#page-30-1)

[assertion labels](#page-30-1) with respect to multiple instances. Additionally, some other assertion types will be technically equivalent to a embedded data assertion, but will have their own unique labels (e.g., c2pa.thumbnail.claim).

## **18.12.2. Technical Details**

Since the embedded data assertion is based on a JUMBF Embedded File content type box, it's Embedded File Description box shall contain an IANA media type (e.g., image/png) as the value of the MEDIA TYPE field, and may contain a file name as the value of the FILE NAME field. It shall not have the External toggle bit set.

**NOTE**

IANA structured suffixes ([https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-type-structured-suffix/media](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-type-structured-suffix/media-type-structured-suffix.xhtml)[type-structured-suffix.xhtml](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-type-structured-suffix/media-type-structured-suffix.xhtml)), such as +json and +zip, are also supported as values of the MEDIA TYPE field.

The Binary Data box of the embedded data assertion shall be the bits of a file (such as a raster image or text prompt) in whatever format is desired by the claim generator, but matches the media type specified in the Embedded File Description box.

## <span id="page-190-0"></span>**18.13. Thumbnail**

## **18.13.1. Description**

A thumbnail assertion provides an approximate visual representation of the asset at a specific event in the lifecycle of an asset. There are currently two specific events:

- ingredient import and claim creation;
- each using a unique label for the assertion.

#### **18.13.1.1. Claim Thumbnails**

For thumbnails created at claim creation time, the thumbnail assertion shall have the label c2pa.thumbnail.claim. There shall be no more than one thumbnail assertion with this label in a C2PA Manifest.

Previous versions of this specification required that the IANA registry media type of the thumbnail be included in the label name (e.g., c2pa.thumbnail.claim.png). This naming convention has been deprecated.

#### **18.13.1.2. Ingredient Thumbnails**

When importing an ingredient (see [Section 10.3.2.2, "Adding Ingredients"\)](#page-48-1), one should reference that ingredient's own manifest-stored thumbnail. However, some ingredients may not include a thumbnail assertion, or even a manifest. In that case, a new thumbnail of the ingredient should be generated, and a new thumbnail assertion in the active manifest created.

The thumbnail assertion for an ingredient shall have a label that starts with c2pa.thumbnail.ingredient and follows the [rules of assertion labels](#page-30-1) with respect to multiple instances. For example, an ingredient thumbnail might have the label c2pa.thumbnail.ingredient\_\_1.

Previous versions of this specification required that the IANA registry media type of the thumbnail be included in the label name (e.g., c2pa.thumbnail.claim.png). This naming convention has been deprecated.

Previous versions of this specification required a \_1 suffix for the first instance, and required a single underscore. The current specification, by adopting consistent naming with all assertions, uses c2pa.thumbnail.ingredient for the first instance, c2pa.thumbnail.ingredient\_\_1 for the second, etc. The previous naming convention has been deprecated.

#### **18.13.1.3. Technical Details**

A thumbnail assertion is an [embedded data assertion](#page-189-0) but with a special label identifying this specific use case.

## <span id="page-191-0"></span>**18.14. Alternative Content Representation**

## **18.14.1. General**

This assertion is used to refer to an alternative digital content that is different from the primary asset, and to provide functionality depending on the referenced digital content. It shall have a label of c2pa.alternative-contentrepresentation.

This assertion has the parameters depending on the file format specification. Individual specifications are specified in the following sections.

## **18.14.2. Original Preservation Image**

#### **18.14.2.1. Description**

This type is used to reference "Original Preservation Image(OPI)" in [CIPA Exif](https://www.cipa.jp/j/std/std-sec.html). The OPI is introduced for recording authenticity of the image at the time of capture in which subsequent post image processing is not applied, along with metadata that describes image properties. This enables users to recognize the difference between the image at the time of capture and the main image developed through the image processing by camera systems when the main image has noticeable differences from the real scene. This assertion enables applications to reference the OPI through a Manifest as an element of provenance data.

Considering that OPI is normally recorded at the time of capture as an individual image in MPF, this assertion provides both

- 1) the method to refer to OPI stored in the Asset (including validation) at capture time and
- 2) the method to move and record the OPI into the manifest

Moving OPI metadata typically occurs during editing, particularly under the following conditions

• when the file format will be changed from Exif and / or

• when the file is used as an ingredient.

When referencing the OPI in MPF, the location shall be specified in the alternative content representation assertion by the index number of the item from the parts array described in the multi-asset hash assertion in the same C2PA Manifest. If the asset is subsequently edited and the OPI is preserved, a new alternative content representation assertion should be included in the new C2PA Manifest, referencing the OPI location in the new multi-asset hash assertion.

**NOTE**

An OPI referenced using a multi-asset part index can only be validated when the alternative content representation assertion exists in the active manifest, or in the presence of update manifests, the standard manifest containing the current hard binding.

When moving the OPI into the C2PA Manifest, the OPI shall be recorded using the embedded data assertion without any changes.

If the OPI in the asset is removed, the action assertion with the pre-defined "c2pa.deleted" shall be used, and when the image in the manifest is removed, the record of remove operation shall be described following the redaction rules (see [Section 6.8, "Redaction of Assertions"](#page-31-3)).

A C2PA Manifest shall not contain more than one alternative content representation assertion with the label exif.originalPreservationImage.

#### **18.14.2.2. Schema and Example**

The schema for this assertion is defined by the original-preservation-image-representation rule in the following [CDDL Definition:](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610)

```
; Describes a reference to an alternative version of the content 
; (e.g. an original preservation image in Exif, a secure capture from TEE, etc.)
alternative-content-representation = 
  original-preservation-image-representation 
  / generic-representation
;The original-preservation-image-representation describes the location of the original
captured scene image.
original-preservation-image-representation = {
  "type": "exif.originalPreservationImage",
  "parameters": original-preservation-image-params
}
original-preservation-image-params = {
  ? "multiAssetPartIndex": uint ; The zero-based index of the element within the parts array
of the corresponding c2pa.hash.multi-asset assertion that uniquely identifies the location
of the OPI.
  ? "embeddedOriginalPreservationImage": hashed-uri-map, ; hashed URI reference to the
embedded data assertion containing OPI, or to another assertion that is technically
equivalent to an embedded data assertion (e.g., c2pa.thumbnail.claim).
}
generic-representation = {
  "type": tstr .regexp "([\\da-zA-Z_-]+\\.)+[\\da-zA-Z_-]+",
  "parameters": { * tstr => any }
```

}

The schema for the c2pa.alternative-content-representation assertion is defined by the following abstract rule, which permits the inclusion of either an original-preservation-image-representation or a generic-representation structure. The type field within the the alternative content representation assertion shall be set to exif.originalPreservationImage. The parameters field shall be the originalpreservation-image-params structure. The original-preservation-image-params structure shall use either the multiAssetPartIndex field to reference OPI data located within the asset in MPF, or the embeddedOriginalPreservationImage field to record the OPI inside the manifest, but shall not use both.

An example in CBOR Diagnostic Format (.cbordiag) is shown below:

```
// The case for reference Original Preservation Image(OPI) data located within the asset in
MPF. //
{
  "type": "exif.originalPreservationImage",
  "parameters": {
  "multiAssetPartIndex": 1
  }
}
// The case for recording the OPI inside the manifest. //
{
  "type": "exif.originalPreservationImage",
  "parameters": {
  "embeddedOriginalPreservationImage" : {
  "url" : "self#jumbf=c2pa.assertions/c2pa.embedded-data",
  "hash": b64'Hf0IgeqbL0m+FTTLpUWwsDGR8pvhUR1AlwvaXjQ0qGY='
  }
  }
}
```

# <span id="page-193-0"></span>**18.15. Actions**

## **18.15.1. Description**

An actions assertion provides information on edits and other actions taken that affect the asset's content. There will be an array of actions - each action declaring what took place on the asset and (optionally) when it took place, along with possible other information such as what software performed the action. Except where noted in [Section 18.15.2,](#page-196-0) ["Mandatory presence of at least one actions assertion",](#page-196-0) the order of actions in this array is unspecified, and does not imply the order in which actions were performed.

There are two versions of the actions assertion - the deprecated v1 (with label c2pa.actions) and the new v2 (which shall have a label of c2pa.actions.v2). Actions are modelled after [XMP ResourceEvents,](https://github.com/adobe/xmp-docs/blob/master/XMPNamespaces/XMPDataTypes/ResourceEvent.md) but with a number of C2PA-specific adjustments.

Actions in a v1 actions assertion are fully specified in the actions array. However, in v2, an action may either be fully specified in an element of the actions array or it may be derived from an element in the templates array with the same action name.

For each action present in either the actions or templates arrays, the value of the action field shall be either a pre-defined action name (c2pa.resized, c2pa.edited, etc.) or entity-specific action name (com.fabrikam.gaussianBlur, etc.).

The set of pre-defined names, prefixed with c2pa. are listed in [Table 8, "List of pre-defined actions":](#page-194-0)

In addition, the following set of pre-defined names (in [Table 9, "List of font actions"\)](#page-195-0), prefixed with font. are used specifically for font assets:

## <span id="page-195-0"></span>**NOTE**

An earlier version of this specification labelled these as c2pa.font, but that has been deprecated in favour of the shorter font prefix.

Table 9. List of font actions

| Action                       | Meaning                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| font.charactersAdded         | Characters or character sets added.                                                           |
| font.charactersDeleted       | Characters or character sets deleted.                                                         |
| font.charactersModified      | Characters or character sets added and deleted.                                               |

## <span id="page-196-0"></span>**18.15.2. Mandatory presence of at least one actions assertion**

There shall be at least one actions assertion present in either the created\_assertions or gathered\_assertions array of the Claim of a [standard C2PA Manifest](#page-62-1). Furthermore:

- If the asset was created de novo (for example, as a result of performing a File → New operation in a creative tool, capturing a photo or video, or generating the media by a generative AI model), then the actions array in the first c2pa.actions assertion in either the created\_assertions or gathered\_assertions array of the Claim shall have a c2pa.created action as its first element.
  - For all assets, a corresponding digitalSourceType field, with an appropriate value, shall be recorded with the c2pa.created action, to indicate the nature of the asset at its inception. If the asset is created with no digital content, then the digitalSourceType field shall have the value [http://c2pa.org/](http://c2pa.org/digitalsourcetype/empty) [digitalsourcetype/empty](http://c2pa.org/digitalsourcetype/empty).
- If the asset was created by opening an existing asset as a parentOf [ingredient](#page-210-0) for editing, then the actions array in the first c2pa.actions assertion in either the created\_assertions or gathered\_assertions array of the Claim shall have a c2pa.opened action as its first element. No digitalSourceType field is required in conjunction with a c2pa.opened action.

**NOTE** This requirement does not apply to [Update Manifests](#page-63-0).

**NOTE** When recording any actions in gathered\_assertions, bear in mind that these assertions are not attributed to the signer (see [Chapter 10,](#page-44-0) [Claims](#page-44-0)).

The full set of actions assertions in a C2PA Manifest shall contain no more than one action whose type is either c2pa.created or c2pa.opened. If one of these actions appears within created\_assertions, then neither shall appear within gathered\_assertions, and if one appears within gathered\_assertions, then neither shall appear within created\_assertions.

EXAMPLE: A generative AI model generates a video in response to a text prompt. The resulting video asset's active manifest would have a c2pa.actions assertion starting with a c2pa.created action, itself having a value of <http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/digitalsourcetype/trainedAlgorithmicMedia> in the corresponding digitalSourceType field.

EXAMPLE: A user opens Emily's Mobile Poster Maker to create an image for a social media post. The user selects a template, then begins customizing it, importing some existing photos in the process. The resulting image asset's active manifest would have a c2pa.actions assertion starting with a c2pa.created action and no digitalSourceType field, indicating that this began as a new file. It would also have a c2pa.placed action for each photo that the user imported, each pointing to a corresponding ingredient assertion where a componentOf relationship is indicated. Finally, it will have additional actions recorded for other operations the user performs.

EXAMPLE: The media desk at a newspaper wants to edit a photo that was captured by a photojournalist with a C2PAenabled camera. The media editor opens the photo and applies crop and vignette operations. The resulting edited photo asset's active manifest has a c2pa.actions assertion with a c2pa.opened action pointing to an ingredient assertion for the original photo, where a parentOf relationship is indicated. It would also have actions for the cropping and vignette edits.

## **18.15.3. All actions included**

The generator should set the actions-map-v2 field, allActionsIncluded, which has a boolean value. If allActionsIncluded has a value of true, then the claim generator is stating that all actions performed on the asset are described in the actions assertion(s). If allActionsIncluded has a value of false, then the claim generator is stating that additional, unrecorded actions may have been performed. Validators should interpret an omitted allActionsIncluded field as indicating that additional, unrecorded actions may have been performed.

### **18.15.4. Fields in the actions assertion**

#### **18.15.4.1. Description**

An action may include a free-text description, in the description field, of what an action does. This is most useful for non-standard actions, however, it may also be used as a way to provide additional information about a standard action. For example, a c2pa.edited action could have a description that says "Paintbrush tool".

#### **18.15.4.2. Reason**

If present, the reason field shall contain one of these standard values, or a custom value which conforms to the same syntax as [entity-specific namespacing](#page-29-4), for the rationale behind the action:

• c2pa.PII.present;

- c2pa.invalid.data;
- c2pa.trade-secret.present;
- c2pa.government.confidential.

**NOTE**

Although the reason field can be used for any actions, only redaction-focused c2pa values are defined at this time.

When using a c2pa.redacted action, the reason field shall contain the rationale for the redaction. Additional requirements for the c2pa.redacted action can be found in [Section 18.15.4.7, "Parameters"](#page-199-0).

#### **18.15.4.3. When**

Also present may be the date and time when the action took place in the when field. If included, the value of the when field shall be compliant with CBOR date/times ([RFC 8949,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949) 3.4.1).

**NOTE** The when field serves as a simple non-trusted time-stamp. UTC-based times are recommended.

#### **18.15.4.4. SoftwareAgent**

The software or hardware used to perform the action can be identified via the softwareAgent field. In a v1 action, this is a simple text string. However, for v2, softwareAgent uses the richer generator-info-map structure as described in [Section 10.2.3.2, "Generator Info Map".](#page-47-2) When multiple softwareAgents are used, as described in [Section](#page-202-0) [18.15.6.2, "SoftwareAgents",](#page-202-0) then the softwareAgentIndex field shall be used to reference the softwareAgent by its 0-based index in the softwareAgents array. A given action shall only have one softwareAgent or softwareAgentIndex field.

**NOTE**

These fields are useful for when the softwareAgent is not the same program as the claim generator.

**NOTE**

An earlier version of this specification also included an actors field, however this was removed in version 2.0.

### **18.15.4.5. Digital Source Type**

An action may include a digitalSourceType key, whose value shall be one of the terms [defined by the IPTC](http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/digitalsourcetype/) or a C2PA specific value from the list below:

#### **<http://c2pa.org/digitalsourcetype/empty>**

Media whose digital content is effectively empty, such as a blank canvas or zero-length video.

#### **<http://c2pa.org/digitalsourcetype/trainedAlgorithmicData>**

Data that is the result of algorithmically using a model derived from sampled content and data. Differs from <http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/digitalsourcetype/trainedAlgorithmicMedia> in that the result isn't a media type (e.g., image or video) but is a data format (e.g., CSV, pickle)

**NOTE**

One common use case for the digitalSourceType key is in conjunction with the c2pa.created action to provide a way to specify how the media item was created - such as "digital capture", "digitised from negative" or "trained algorithmic media".

For "trained algorithmic" assets and data, such as those created by Generative AI, one or more [ingredients](#page-209-0) may be added to the C2PA Manifest to provide info about the inputs that led to the production of the asset. They can be referenced from a c2pa.placed or c2pa.created action as shown in [Example 8, "Example of an action for](#page-199-1) [Generative AI"](#page-199-1).

#### **18.15.4.6. Changes**

The action may be specific to only a portion of an asset - such as a range of frames in a video or a specific area on an image. In v1, the value was a simple text string. For v2, they are identified using a changes field, whose value is an array of region-map objects (as defined in [Section 18.2, "Regions of Interest"](#page-133-2)).

#### <span id="page-199-0"></span>**18.15.4.7. Parameters**

An action may include a parameters key that provides for the specification of some action-specific information via some pre-defined as well as the open-ended inclusion of any custom fields (and their associated values). Custom fields shall conform to the same syntax as [entity-specific namespacing](#page-29-4), e.g. com.litware.someFieldName.

**NOTE**

This is useful for providing extra information that would be useful to a specific workflow or C2PA Manifest Consumer.

A claim generator that performs the same action over and over, with the same parameters & settings, may use the multipleInstances field to indicate that the action was performed multiple times or not. If the multipleInstances field is not present, then it is unknown whether the action was performed multiple times.

When using a c2pa.opened or c2pa.placed action, the ingredient field (for v1) or ingredients field (for v2) in the parameters object shall contain the hashed JUMBF URIs to one or more related ingredient assertions. In a c2pa.removed action, this field shall contain the hashed JUMBF URI to a componentOf ingredient assertion in a different manifest. In some cases, only a portion of an ingredient is relevant to the action, in such cases the ingredient assertion should contain [assertion metadata](#page-142-0) containing a regionOfInterest field which would be used to specify the relevant regions of the ingredient (as described in [Section 18.16.13, "Ingredient Metadata"](#page-221-0)).

**NOTE**

In previous versions of this specification, c2pa.transcoded and c2pa.repackaged actions were required to reference the parentOf ingredient assertion referenced by the preceding c2pa.opened action; claim generators can do so for compatibility with older validators.

When using a c2pa.translated action, the sourceLanguage and targetLanguage fields in the parameters object shall contain [RFC 5646, BCP 47](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646) language codes.

<span id="page-199-1"></span>Example 8. Example of an action for Generative AI

The c2pa.created action for an image created by a Generative AI model, could look like this, in CBOR

diagnostic notation [\(RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), clause 8):

```
// an actions assertion used to describe output of Generative AI //
{
  "actions": [
  {
  "action": "c2pa.created",
  "when": 0("2023-02-11T09:00:00Z"),
  "softwareAgent" : {
  "name": "Joe's Photo Editor",
  "version": "2.0",
  "operating_system": "Windows 10"
  },
  "digitalSourceType":
"http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/digitalsourcetype/trainedAlgorithmicMedia",
  "parameters" : {
  "ingredients" : [ 
  {
  "url": "self#jumbf=c2pa.assertions/c2pa.ingredient.v3", 
  "alg": "sha256",
  "hash" : b64'...',
  },
  {
  "url": "self#jumbf=c2pa.assertions/c2pa.ingredient.v3__1", 
  "alg": "sha256",
  "hash" : b64'...',
  }
  ]
  }
  }
  ]
}
```

When using a c2pa.redacted action, the redacted field in the parameters object shall contain the JUMBF URI to the assertion that has been redacted.

### **18.15.5. Watermarking**

When using a`c2pa.watermarked.bound` action, a [soft binding assertion](#page-180-0) shall also be included in the C2PA Manifest to describe the inserted watermark.

**NOTE**

The c2pa.watermarked action is deprecated in favour of the more specific c2pa.watermarked.bound and c2pa.watermarked.unbound actions.

## **18.15.6. Action Templates**

#### **18.15.6.1. Templates**

The elements of the templates array, in a v2 action, are described using a combination of common elements about actions, along with some template-specific values. These values are combined by a C2PA Manifest Consumer with actions of the same name, or with all actions (if the value of the action field is the special value), to get a full picture of an action. If there are multiple templates that apply to the same action, then the values are merged starting with the template (if present) and then applied in the order they appear in the templates array.

Example 9. Action template example

An action and template, in CBOR diagnostic notation ([RFC 8949,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949) clause 8):

```
// example of a single template applied to multiple actions //
{
  "actions": [
  {
  "action": "com.joesphoto.filter",
  "when": 0("2020-02-11T09:00:00Z")
  },
  {
  "action": "c2pa.edited",
  "when": 0("2020-02-11T09:10:00Z")
  },
  {
  "action": "com.joesphoto.filter",
  "when": 0("2020-02-11T09:20:00Z")
  },
  {
  "action": "c2pa.cropped",
  "when": 0("2020-02-11T09:30:00Z")
  }
  ],
  "templates": [{
  "action": "com.joesphoto.filter",
  "description": "Magic Filter",
  "digitalSourceType":
"http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/digitalsourcetype/compositeSynthetic",
  "softwareAgent" : {
  "name": "Joe's Photo Editor",
  "version": "2.0",
  "operating_system": "Windows 10"
  }
  }]
}
// example of using the special all actions/`*` template, for all actions //
{
  "actions": [
  {
  "action": "c2pa.created",
  "when": 0("2024-03-09T20:04Z")
  },
  {
  "action": "c2pa.edited",
  "when": 0("2025-02-11T09:10:00Z")
  },
  {
  "action": "c2pa.cropped",
  "when": 0("2025-02-11T09:30:00Z")
  }
  ],
  "templates": [{
  "action": "*",
  "digitalSourceType":
```

```
"http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/digitalsourcetype/humanEdits",
  "softwareAgent" : {
  "name": "Jane's Human Authoring Tool",
  "version": "1.0"
  }
  }]
}
```

A C2PA Manifest Consumer shall take the values from the template and overlay the values from the action itself, which will lead to replacing any with the same name.

![](_page_202_Figure_2.jpeg)

Figure 18. Actions Template Flow

A template may include a templateParameters key that allows the inclusion of any other keys (and their associated values). This is useful for providing extra information that would be useful to a specific workflow or C2PA Manifest Consumer.

#### <span id="page-202-0"></span>**18.15.6.2. SoftwareAgents**

If multiple softwareAgents were used, they can be listed in the softwareAgents field instead. This field is an array of generator-info-map objects, each of which describes a different software or hardware which can then be referenced by its index via the softwareAgentIndex field of a given action or template.

Example 10. Software Agents example

An example of specifying multiple agents across multiple actions, in CBOR diagnostic notation [\(RFC 8949,](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949) clause 8):

```
{
  "actions": [
  {
  "action": "com.joesphoto.magic-avatar",
  "when": 0("2020-02-11T09:00:00Z"),
  "softwareAgentIndex" : 0
  },
  {
  "action": "c2pa.edited",
  "when": 0("2020-02-11T09:10:00Z")
  "softwareAgentIndex" : 1
  },
  {
  "action": "com.joesphoto.beauty-filter",
  "when": 0("2020-02-11T09:20:00Z"),
  "softwareAgentIndex" : 0
  },
  {
  "action": "com.joesphoto.all-smiles",
  "when": 0("2020-02-11T09:40:00Z"),
```

```
  "softwareAgentIndex" : 0
  },
  {
  "action": "c2pa.cropped",
  "when": 0("2020-02-11T09:30:00Z")
  "softwareAgentIndex" : 1
  },
  {
  "action": "com.joesphoto.green-screen",
  "when": 0("2020-02-11T09:50:00Z"),
  "softwareAgentIndex" : 0
  }
  ],
  "softwareAgents": [
  {
  "name": "Joe's AI Filter",
  "version": "1.0",
  "operating_system": "Windows 10"
  }
  {
  "name": "Joe's Photo Editor",
  "version": "2.0",
  "operating_system": "Windows 10"
  }
  ]
}
```

#### **18.15.6.3. Icons**

A template may also include an icon - an image (raster or vector) that can be used in the C2PA Manifest Consumer's user experience to provide some graphic representation of the action. Since a Manifest Consumer will know about all the defined actions, such icons shall only be present in templates for entity-specific actions.

The value of the icon field, if present, shall be a [hashed URI.](#page-37-2) This hashed URI shall be to either a [embedded data](#page-189-0) [assertion](#page-189-0) or to a [cloud data assertion](#page-188-0). If a embedded data assertion is used, then its label shall be c2pa.icon and shall follow the [rules of assertion labels](#page-30-1) with respect to multiple instances.

**NOTE** This icon field is identical in structure to the icon field in the [Generator Info Map](#page-47-2) of the Claim.

Manifest Consumers should also support the [data box](#page-34-0) approach recommended by earlier versions of this specification.

## **18.15.7. Localizations**

If the metadata of an actions assertion contains a [localization dictionary](#page-146-1) for a template, then the localizations shall also apply to any action based on that template.

### **18.15.8. Related Actions**

When a series of actions are related to each other, usually taking place at the same time, it can be useful to associate them accordingly. The related field, in the v2 action, provides a place to list the additional actions that are related. Each related action should be a subset of the primary action, only including those fields that differ. Just as with an action template, the values are merged with those of the primary action, by a C2PA Manifest Consumer to get a full picture of each related action.

## **18.15.9. Asset Renditions**

Asset renditions are a common occurrence when distributing media on the internet. These renditions are often created for the purpose of delivering media to consumers in differing connectivity, screen resolution, and other environments. We can use the actions assertion to help consuming actors understand the intention of certain claim creators to create asset renditions.

The presence of only c2pa.published, c2pa.transcoded and c2pa.repackaged actions in a c2pa.actions assertion provides a signal to the Manifest Consumer that the signer is asserting that no [editorial](#page-11-3) [changes](#page-11-3) to the digital content have happened between the ingredient asset(s) and this one.

The additional presence of a single "parentOf" ingredient provides a further signal to the Manifest Consumer that the signer is asserting that the asset has been derived directly from that parent.

## **18.15.10. Soft Binding Lookup**

When performing either a c2pa.opened or c2pa.placed action with an asset that does not contain a C2PA Manifest, the claim generator may use a soft binding lookup to find the C2PA Manifest for that asset. If successful, the claim generator should add the located C2PA Manifest as the value of the activeManifest field in the ingredient assertion. If it does so, then the ingredient assertion shall also contain a softBindingsMatched field with a value of true and a softBindingAlgorithmsMatched whose value contains at least one entry in the array.

**NOTE** Adding these fields indicates to the C2PA Manifest consumer that soft binding lookup was used.

**NOTE**

Since most soft binding recovered manifests will contain a hard binding assertion that does not match the asset being looked up, it is to be expected that validation failures will be reported in the ingredient assertion.

An example of an ingredient action showing that its manifest was retrieved via soft binding, in CBOR diagnostic notation [\(RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), clause 8):

```
// an ingredient assertion that had its manifest recovered via soft-binding //
{
  "dc:title": "image 1.jpg",
  "dc:format": "image/jpeg",
  "relationship": "parentOf",
  "softBindingsMatched": true,

  ]

  },
```

```
}
// an actions assertion pointing to the ingredient //
{
  "actions": [
  {
  "action": "c2pa.opened",

  }
  ]
  }
  }
  ]
}
```

### **18.15.11. Deprecated Actions**

The following actions were part of previous versions of this specification and have since been deprecated:

```
• c2pa.copied;
```

- c2pa.formatted;
- c2pa.version\_updated;
- c2pa.printed;
- c2pa.managed;
- c2pa.produced;
- c2pa.saved.

They shall no longer be written into c2pa.actions or c2pa.actions.v2 assertions but may appear in preexisting C2PA Manifests.

### **18.15.12. Schema and Example**

The schema for c2pa.actions is defined by the actions-map rule, and the schema for c2pa.actions.v2 is defined by the actions-map-v2 rule in the following [CDDL Definition](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610):

## <span id="page-209-0"></span>**18.16. Ingredient**

## **18.16.1. Description**

When assets are composed together, for example placing an image into a layer in an image editing tool or an audio clip into a video in a video editing tool, it is important that information about any claim from the placed asset be recorded into the new asset to provide a way to understand the entire history of the new composed asset. This is also true when an existing asset is used to create a derived asset or asset rendition.

Another common use for an ingredient is to describe some assets or data that were used as input to a process, such as the training or inference requests associated with an AI/ML model.

There are three versions of the ingredients assertion - the deprecated v1 (with label c2pa.ingredient), the deprecated v2 (with label c2pa.ingredient.v2), and the current v3 (which shall have a label of c2pa.ingredient.v3), which addresses the issue of validating ingredients after redaction.

**NOTE**

When there is more than one ingredient assertion, the [usual labelling rules](#page-30-1) apply (e.g., c2pa.ingredient.v3, c2pa.ingredient.v3*1*, c2pa.ingredient.v32).

### **18.16.2. Establishing unique identifiers**

If the ingredient being added contains a C2PA Manifest, then its unique identifier shall be taken from the [manifest](#page-35-1) [label](#page-35-1) of the JUMBF superbox containing the ingredient's active C2PA Manifest, and it is not necessary to provide the optional instanceID field of the ingredient assertion. When the claim generator provides the optional instanceID field of the ingredient assertion, then the value of the unique identifier shall be determined as specified by [Section 8.3, "Identifying Non-C2PA Assets".](#page-36-1)

**NOTE**

A claim generator can provide an instanceID field in the ingredient assertion even if the ingredient has a C2PA Manifest.

## <span id="page-210-0"></span>**18.16.3. Relationship**

When adding an ingredient, its relationship to the current asset shall be described. The possible values of the relationship field and their meanings are shown in [Table 10, "Ingredient Relationships"](#page-210-1).

Table 10. Ingredient Relationships

<span id="page-210-1"></span>

| Value       | Meaning                                                                                                                                             |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| parentOf    | The current asset is a derived asset or asset rendition of<br>this ingredient. This relationship value is also used with<br>update manifests.       |
| componentOf | The current asset is composed of multiple parts, this<br>ingredient being one of them.                                                              |
| inputTo     | This ingredient was used as input to a computational<br>process, such as an AI/ML model, that led to the creation<br>or modification of this asset. |

When adding an ingredient assertion, a claim generator shall add a c2pa.actions assertion (see [Section 18.15,](#page-193-0) ["Actions"\)](#page-193-0), if one does not already exist in the active manifest. Depending on the type of ingredient, one of the following new entries shall be added to the actions array of a c2pa.actions assertion.

- When adding an ingredient with a parentOf relationship, a c2pa.opened action shall be added to the actions array.
- When adding an ingredient with a componentOf relationship, a c2pa.placed action shall be added to the actions array.

This requirement only applies to [Standard Manifests,](#page-62-1) since recording actions is only supported in that manifest type.

## **18.16.4. Title**

If present, the value of dc:title shall be a human-readable name for the ingredient, which may be taken either from the asset's XMP or the asset's name in a local or remote (e.g., cloud-based) filesystem. If the ingredient does not have a specific name, then a description of the ingredient may be used instead.

## **18.16.5. Format**

If present, the value of dc:format shall be the IANA Media Type for the ingredient. It is recommended that a claim generator should provide this field and it shall contain a valid value. When describing a [multi-file ingredient](#page-216-0), such as the data set of an AI/ML model, the dc:format field shall be set to multipart/mixed.

## **18.16.6. Schema and Example**

## **18.16.7. Description field**

An ingredient may include a free-text description, in the description field, of what an the ingredient is or is used for. This is useful for situations where neither the title nor the format is sufficient.

### **18.16.8. Ingredient Data**

#### **18.16.8.1. Standard Usage**

In certain use cases, such as Generative AI, it may be important to have ingredients where the data of the ingredient is provided - either embedded into the C2PA Manifest or via a URL that references the data. This is accomplished through the data field in the ingredient, which uses a hashed-uri to point to an [embedded data assertion](#page-189-0) or a hashed-ext-uri-map to point to an external reference.

**NOTE** Previous versions of this specification allowed the hashed\_uri to point to a [data box.](#page-34-0)

Using an [embedded data assertion](#page-189-0) implies that its content will be embedded in this C2PA Manifest and in any future C2PA Manifest (unless redacted) that contains this asset as an ingredient. Claim generators should take the size of this field into consideration when choosing whether to embed data.

Example 12. Example of ingredients with data

An example of some ingredients with data, in CBOR diagnostic notation [\(RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), clause 8):

```
// prompt's data box //
{
  "dc:format": "text/plain",
  "data" : 'pirate with bird on shoulder'
  "dataTypes": [{
  "type": "c2pa.types.generator.prompt",
  }]
}
// ingredient (prompt) //
{
  "dc:title": "prompt",
  "dc:format": "text/plain",
  "relationship": "inputTo",
  "data": {
  "url": "self#jumbf=c2pa.assertions/c2pa.embedded-data", 
  "alg" : "sha256",
  "hash" : b64'...',
  }
```

```
}
// ingredient (model) //
{
  "dc:title": "model",
  "dc:format": "application/octet-stream",
  "dataTypes": [
  {
  "type": "c2pa.types.generator",
  },
  {
  "type": "c2pa.types.model.tensorflow",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  },
  {
  "type": "c2pa.types.tensorflow.hubmodule",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  }
  ],
  "relationship": "inputTo",
  "data": {
  "url": "https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/bigbigan-resnet50/1?tf-hub-format=compressed",
  "alg" : "sha256",
  "hash" : b64'...',
  },
  "description": "Unsupervised BigBiGAN image generation & representation learning
model trained on ImageNet with a smaller (ResNet-50) encoder architecture.",
  "informationalURI": "https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/bigbigan-resnet50/1",
}
```

There are also use cases where it is important to identify information about the ingredient's data but it is neither possible to embed it nor provide a valid URL - for example, when describing the use of a private/internal AI model. For those cases, an [asset type](#page-227-0), as the value of the data\_types field, can be provided for more clarity on the format and description of that data.

Example 13. Example of ingredients with data\_types

An example of an ingredient without a hashed uri, in CBOR diagnostic notation [\(RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), clause 8):

```
// ingredient (private model) //
{
  "dc:title": "model",
  "dc:format": "application/octet-stream",
  "relationship": "inputTo",
  "dataTypes": [
  {
  "type": "c2pa.types.generator",
  },
  {
  "type": "c2pa.types.model.tensorflow",
  "version": "1.5.0",
  }
  ],
  "description": "Joe's private generative AI model",
  "informationalURI": "https://www.example.com/joes-model-info.html"
```

### <span id="page-216-0"></span>**18.16.8.2. Multi-file Ingredients**

In some cases, an ingredient may be represented as a set of multiple files, such as the training data set for an AI/ML model. It is recommended that in those instances that the [C2PA Manifest](#page-216-1) be included in the ingredient assertion and that the C2PA Manifest for the full data set include an [asset reference assertion](#page-226-0) that references where to find those files.

**NOTE**

This method is well suited for when working with a collection of assets where all of the files are not contained in the same hierarchy.

### **18.16.9. Informational URI**

When it is necessary to provide a URL to a web page with information about the ingredient, such as detailed information about an AI/ML model, it should be placed as the value of the informationalURI field of the ingredient assertion.

**NOTE**

The informationalURI is not an authenticated link to the content of the ingredient itself, but something more generally of interest to a human user.

**NOTE**

Older (and deprecated) versions of the ingredient assertion named this field informational\_URI.

### **18.16.10. Thumbnails**

When adding an ingredient, it may be useful to also include a thumbnail of the ingredient to help establish the state of the ingredient at the time of import. For that purpose, a thumbnail shall be added as a [thumbnail assertion](#page-190-0) and referenced herein via a hashed-uri reference.

Manifest Consumers should also support the [data box](#page-34-0) approach recommended by earlier versions of this specification.

## <span id="page-216-1"></span>**18.16.11. Existing manifests**

### **18.16.11.1. General**

If the ingredient has an existing C2PA Manifest Store, then all C2PA Manifests in the ingredient's C2PA Manifest Store that have undergone validation, and that do not already exist in the asset's C2PA Manifest Store, shall be copied by the claim generator into the asset's C2PA Manifest Store, except as outlined in [Section 18.16.12, "Copying existing](#page-217-0) [manifests"](#page-217-0) or when directed not to do so (for example via user input or via configuration).

The claim generator should also copy into the asset's C2PA Manifest Store any additional C2PA Manifests that were not validated, as well as any additional JUMBF boxes and superboxes appearing in the C2PA Manifest Store that are not recognized as C2PA Manifests.

**NOTE**

Copying these additional elements supports compatibility with custom assertions and future constructs that may reference elements of the C2PA Manifest Store in ways that the claim generator does not recognize.

## <span id="page-217-0"></span>**18.16.12. Copying existing manifests**

#### **18.16.12.1. Determining the need**

To determine whether or not an existing manifest from the ingredient's C2PA Manifest Store needs to be copied into the asset's C2PA Manifest Store, the claim generator shall:

- 1. Validate the ingredient per the process described in [Section 18.16.12.4, "Ingredient validation"](#page-218-0). In case of validation failures, the claim generator may skip the rest of these steps if directed to do so (for example, via user input or via configuration).
- 2. For each manifest in the ingredient's C2PA Manifest Store, compare its [URN identifier](#page-35-0) with the URN identifiers of each C2PA Manifest already present in the asset's C2PA Manifest Store.
  - a. If a match is found, compute and compare the hash of the manifest box from ingredient's C2PA Manifest Store to the hash of the matching manifest box from the asset's C2PA Manifest Store
    - i. If the hashes match, then the claim generator shall not copy the manifest from the ingredient's C2PA Manifest Store to the asset's C2PA Manifest Store.
    - ii. If the hashes do not match:
      - A. The claim generator shall check if any assertions from either manifest were redacted (optionally utilizing the list of redactions compiled in the [Performing explicit validation](#page-115-0) process).
        - I. If the validator is able to determine that the hashes differ only due to redaction, then:
          - 1. If all redactions were applied against the manifest already present in the asset's C2PA Manifest Store, then the claim generator shall not copy the manifest from the ingredient's C2PA Manifest Store into the asset's C2PA Manifest Store.
          - 2. If all redactions were applied against the manifest from the ingredient's Manifest Store, then the claim generator shall replace the manifest in the asset's C2PA Manifest Store with the manifest from the ingredient's C2PA Manifest Store.
          - 3. If different redactions were applied against both the C2PA Manifest from the ingredient's C2PA Manifest Store and the asset's C2PA Manifest Store, then the claim generator shall redact as many assertions as needed from the existing manifest in the asset's C2PA Manifest Store to result in a union of the two sets of redactions.
        - II. In all other cases, then the claim generator shall copy the manifest from the ingredient's C2PA Manifest Store, re-label it with an updated URN per the process described in [Unique Identifiers](#page-35-0), and insert the re-labeled version into the asset's C2PA Manifest Store.

**NOTE**

The process for determining whether the hashes differ only due to redaction is left up to the validator.

#### **18.16.12.2. Examples**

**EXAMPLE:** Consider a claim generator D that is importing ingredients. It begins by importing ingredient B, which itself has an ingredient Manifest A. After validating both manifests, claim generator D copies Manifests B and A into Asset D 's C2PA Manifest Store. Then it imports ingredient C, which also includes a redacted version of Manifest A. After validating Manifest C and the redacted Manifest A, it compares the hashes of both versions of Manifest A. Knowing that the version of Manifest A in ingredient C was redacted, claim generator D over-writes the version of Manifest A already present in asset D 's C2PA Manifest Store with the redacted version of Manifest A from ingredient C.

**EXAMPLE:** Consider the same scenario as above, except that the version of Manifest A in ingredient C failed validation because one of its assertions failed a hash comparison. In this situation, Claim generator D copies Manifest A from ingredient C, re-labels it with a new URN, and places the re-labeled copy in asset D 's C2PA Manifest Store.

**NOTE**

A C2PA Manifest Store can contain JUMBF boxes or superboxes that are not C2PA Manifests. They need not be copied as part of this process.

#### **18.16.12.3. Adding manifest references to the ingredient assertion**

If the active manifest of the ingredient has been copied into the asset's C2PA Manifest Store, then a [URI reference](#page-37-0) to the ingredient's active [C2PA Manifest box](#page-58-0) shall be stored as the value of the activeManifest field in the ingredient assertion, and an additional [URI reference](#page-37-0) to the active Manifest's [C2PA Claim Signature box](#page-58-0) shall be stored as the value of claimSignature.

For a C2PA Manifest present in the C2PA Manifest Store, hashed\_uri`s shall be used as the values for both of the ingredient assertion's `activeManifest and claimSignature fields.

**NOTE**

Providing both values enables efficient ingredient validation and also supports validation if one of the ingredient's assertions were redacted.

#### <span id="page-218-0"></span>**18.16.12.4. Ingredient validation**

#### **18.16.12.4.1. General**

In addition, when the ingredient assertion references a C2PA Manifest, the claim generator shall also act as a validator, performing validation of the ingredient as described in [validation steps.](#page-82-1) The result of that validation - all [success codes,](#page-86-1) [informational codes](#page-88-0), and [failure codes](#page-89-0) - shall be used in populating the ingredient assertion's validationResults or validationStatus field as described below. This field is required to be present so that it can be used in future validations.

**NOTE**

The presence of a validationStatus (ingredient v2) or validationResults (ingredient v3) with a failure status is considered an explicit statement by the claim generator that an actor has acknowledged validation errors in the ingredient's C2PA Claim itself and has chosen to proceed with incorporating the ingredient.

As described in [Section 15.3, "Displaying Manifest Information"](#page-94-0), it is desirable for a claim generator to prominently raise warnings so that an actor making use of an asset with a flawed provenance history is making an informed decision of how to proceed.

#### **18.16.12.4.2. V2 ingredient assertions (DEPRECATED)**

In a v2 ingredient assertion with no c2pa\_manifest field, the validationStatus field is optional, but if present may contain an empty array.

In a v2 ingredient assertion with c2pa\_manifest field, each object in the validationStatus array consists of a code field whose value describes the validation status of a specific part of the manifest along with an optional success field whose boolean value indicates whether the code reflects success (true) or failure (false). An optional description of the validation status may be present in the explanation field if there is a need for an additional human readable explanation. In addition, each status-map object has a url field which should contain, in the case of failures, a JUMBF URI reference to the specific element in the manifest about which the status refers. Depending on the code, the url will be to a C2PA Claim, a C2PA Claim Signature or a specific C2PA Assertion. Status codes are defined in [Section 15.2.2, "Standard Status Codes"](#page-86-0).

Custom status codes are permitted when a claim generator has a need to record some process-specific status information. The code shall conform to the same syntax as [entity-specific namespaces](#page-29-4) (e.g. com.litware.malformedFrobber) and the validationStatus object shall contain a success boolean.

#### **18.16.12.4.3. V3 ingredient assertions**

In a v3 ingredient assertion with no activeManifest field, the validationResults field shall not be present.

In a v3 ingredient assertion with an activeManifest field, the validationResults field shall contain a validation-results-map object which in turn shall contain:

- 1. In activeManifest, full validation results for the ingredient's active manifest.
- 2. In ingredientDeltas, delta validation results for every ingredient assertion, that contains an activeManifest field, in every manifest in the ingredient's C2PA Manifest Store. The delta validation results for an ingredient assertion shall contain the following:
  - a. In ingredientAssertionURI, the URI of the ingredient assertion.
  - b. In validationDeltas, the validation results for the manifest referenced by the ingredient assertion, omitting any status values present in the activeManifest field of the validationResults field in the ingredient assertion (or for v1 or v2 ingredient assertions, the validationStatus field). This status value

comparison shall consider the status type (success, informational, or failure), code, and url, ignoring other fields.

**EXAMPLE:** Consider a multi-ingredient Manifest E with a complex lineage. Claim generator E adds Manifest C and Manifest D as ingredients via ingredient assertions. Manifest C itself has Manifest A and Manifest B added via ingredient assertions. Manifest D also has Manifest A added via an ingredient assertion. When adding Manifest C, claim generator E creates an ingredient assertion with a validationResults object that stores validation results for the active manifest of C in activeManifest, and delta validation results for manifests A and B in ingredientDeltas. The ingredientDeltas array will have two elements: one for the delta results compared against the activeManifest object in the validationResults object in Manifest C 's ingredient assertion of Manifest B (with a hashed-uri link to said ingredient assertion in Manifest C), and another element of the same attributes but for Manifest C 's ingredient assertion of Manifest A. And likewise when adding Manifest D, claim generator E creates an ingredient assertion which stores validationResults for both the activeManifest of D, as well as ingredientDeltas with a single array element containing delta validation results compared against the activeManifest object in the validationResults object in Manifest D 's ingredient assertion of Manifest A.

**NOTE**

While this is an intentionally contrived example, it is designed to elucidate the expectation of how the validationResults data structure is to be used.

<span id="page-220-0"></span>Each validation result (as described using a status-codes-map), consists of an array of success, informational, and failure codes. Each code is represented as a status-map object which shall contain a code field with the status code. In addition, it may contain a url field with a JUMBF URI reference to the specific element in the manifest about which the status refers, and an optional explanation field with a human-readable explanation of the status. Status codes are defined in [Section 15.2.2, "Standard Status Codes"](#page-86-0).

Custom status codes are permitted when a claim generator has a need to record some process-specific status information. The code shall conform to the same syntax as [entity-specific namespaces](#page-29-4) (e.g. com.litware.malformedFrobber).

Additionally, a validation-results-map may contain a SemVer formatted specVersion field which represents the version of this specification that was used as the basis for the validation procedure. It may also contain a trustListURI field, which is a URI that identifies the trust list that was used to [validate the claim signature.](#page-98-1)

EXAMPLE: For C2PA 2.3, the value of specVersion would be 2.3.0.

If the C2PA Trust List was used to validate the claim signature, the trustListURI field shall not be present. If present, its value shall be a URI.

**NOTE**

trustListURI is a URI and not a URL, meaning that it need not resolve to an actual machinereadable list, but instead is a unique identifier for a specific trust list.

## <span id="page-221-0"></span>**18.16.13. Ingredient Metadata**

As described in [assertion metadata,](#page-142-0) the metadata field of the ingredient assertion may contain metadata about the ingredient, such as the date and time when it was generated or other data that may help Manifest Consumers to make informed decisions about the provenance or veracity of the assertion data.

One common use for the metadata field is when only a portion of an ingredient is used in the creation or editing of an asset. In such cases, the metadata field should contain a regionOfInterest field (as described in [Section](#page-146-2) [18.3.6, "Region of Interest"\)](#page-146-2) which describes the relevant portions of the ingredient that were used. An example of this can be found in [Example 14, "Example of ingredient with metadata containing regions"](#page-221-1).

**NOTE**

Although the field contains only a single region of interest, the region-map object can specify multiple regions as the values of its region field. This would be useful when multiple parts of a single ingredient are involved.

### **18.16.14. Soft Bindings**

An active manifest may include a C2PA Manifest as an ingredient (via a parentOf relationship) that was discovered using a soft binding lookup. If the Claim Generator does include such a C2PA Manifest, then it shall include a softBindingsMatched field indicating true, and a softBindingAlgorithmsMatched field containing an array of strings (of soft binding algorithm names that were used to discover the ingredient C2PA Manifest). The algorithm names shall be listed with the C2PA Soft Binding Algorithm List as identified within the alg field of entries in that list.

## <span id="page-222-0"></span>**18.17. Metadata**

## **18.17.1. Description**

In earlier versions of this specification, there were individual assertions for each metadata standard (e.g., IPTC, EXIF). In this version, there now exists a category of assertions that shall be used to represent metadata, in a standardized serialization. Having the metadata in an assertion establishes that the metadata in that assertion is significant, because it has been explicitly included in the C2PA Manifest, and signed by a specific signer - thus enabling cryptographic validation and attribution of the data. In addition, by using a common serialization, it enables manifest consumers to process it in a consistent manner.

**NOTE** These assertions can represent existing standards or they can be private specifications.

### <span id="page-222-1"></span>**18.17.2. Common Requirements**

A metadata assertion shall have a label which ends in the string .metadata, and is preceded by either the standard c2pa identifier or any other provided that it conforms to the same syntax as [entity-specific namespaces](#page-29-4). For example, a com.litware.metadata assertion would be valid.

Each metadata assertion shall contain a single JSON content type box containing the [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld) serialization of one or more metadata values. The @context property within the JSON-LD object shall be included, and used to provide context / namespaces for the metadata standards being specified. The recommended procedure to create this JSON-LD object is to first create an [XMP Data Model](https://www.iso.org/standard/57421.html) representation of the metadata and then serialize that to JSON-LD according to [JSON-LD serialization of XMP](https://www.iso.org/standard/79384.html). The JSON-LD would then be stored as a JSON content type box.

## **18.17.3. The c2pa.metadata assertion**

This specification defines one metadata assertion, whose label is c2pa.metadata, which is used to represent a subset of common metadata schemas that may be used in any C2PA Manifest. The metadata fields that may be included in this assertion are documented in [Appendix B,](#page-273-0) [Implementation Details for](#page-273-0) *[c2pa.metadata](#page-273-0)*.

}
```

## **18.17.4. Redaction of c2pa.metadata**

Although the redaction process works in such a way that only an entire assertion could be redacted (see [Section 6.8,](#page-31-3) ["Redaction of Assertions"\)](#page-31-3), the use of an [update manifest](#page-63-0) enables partial redaction by removing the original and then placing the new, reduced, versions in the update manifest. This new assertion would be presented in a user experience in association with the signer of the update manifest and not with the signer of the C2PA Manifest that has been redacted.

For example, a metadata assertion containing both location data and camera information which needs to have the location data redacted could be done through an update manifest with a new metadata assertion containing only the camera information.

## <span id="page-224-0"></span>**18.18. Time-stamps**

### **18.18.1. Description**

In some provenance workflows, a standard or update manifest is created offline, where it is not possible to obtain a trusted time-stamp (as per [RFC 3161\)](http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3161) from a TSA at the time of signing. However, in such cases those signing certificates will expire after a certain period of time, thus leading to an invalid C2PA Manifest.

To prevent that expiration, a trusted time-stamp can be added at a later point in time (provided the certificate has not yet expired) providing for a "proof of existence" for that C2PA Manifest and (in the case of the active manifest) its associated asset. This time-stamp assertion is used to provide a trusted time-stamp for such C2PA Manifests.

## **18.18.2. Schema and Example**

The schema for this type is defined by the time-stamp-map rule in the following [CDDL Definition:](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610)

```
; The data structures used to store an array of
; manifest URNs to time-stamp "blobs"
$time-stamp-map /= {
  * $$time-stamp-entry => bstr
}
time-stamp-entry /= tstr .regexp "^urn:c2pa:[\\da-zA-Z_-]+$"
```

An example in CBOR diagnostic notation [\(RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), clause 8) is shown below:

```
{
  "urn:c2pa:d61c74e0-ce26-4439-b92d-690dcce6b58e" : h'...',
  "urn:c2pa:ab8c2751-8711-455a-9a8b-37143bfc92c2" : h'...'
}
```

## **18.18.3. Requirements**

A time-stamp assertion shall have a label of c2pa.time-stamp, and there shall be at most one time-stamp assertion per C2PA Manifest.

The time-stamp assertion consists of a CBOR map (defined as a time-stamp-map) which shall contain at least one key-value pair (defined as a time-stamp-entry). The key shall be the label of the C2PA Manifest that is being timestamped, and the value shall be a CBOR byte string whose contents are described in the following paragraph.

The value for each time-stamp-entry shall be the same binary data found in the timeStampToken field of the TimeStampResp structure received in reply from an RFC 3161-compliant Time Stamping Authority (TSA) [\(RFC 3161\)](http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3161) using detached content mode. The TimeStampResp itself shall be obtained using the same process as described in [Section 10.3.2.5.3, "Obtaining the time-stamp"](#page-49-2), with the exception that the value of payload shall be the value of the signature field of the COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged structure contained in the C2PA Claim Signature box of the C2PA Manifest that is being time-stamped.

## <span id="page-225-0"></span>**18.19. Certificate Status**

## **18.19.1. Description**

In some provenance workflows, a standard or update manifest is created offline, where it is not possible to obtain the revocation information (via OCSP) at the time of signing. Without that information available during the validation process, a validator may need to go online to determine the revocation status of the certificate. This assertion is used to provide the trusted certificate status for such C2PA Manifests, by adding the information after the fact.

## **18.19.2. Schema and Example**

The schema for this type is defined by the cert-status-map rule in the following [CDDL Definition:](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610)

```
certificate-status-map = {
  "ocspVals": [1* bstr] 
}
```

An example in CBOR Diagnostic Format (.cbordiag) is shown below:

```
{
  "ocspVals" : [
  h'...',
  h'...'
  ]
```

}

## **18.19.3. Requirements**

A certificate status assertion shall have a label of c2pa.certificate-status, and a C2PA Manifest shall contain at most one certificate status assertion.

The certificate status assertion consists of a CBOR map (defined as a certificate-status-map) and shall contain at least one entry in the ocspVals array. As described in [Section 14.5.2, "Certificate Revocation"](#page-80-1), the claim generator queries the OCSP service indicated by the signing certificate, captures the response, and shall store it the same binary format as used when it is stored as an element of the ocspVals array of the rVals header (see [Example 3, "CDDL for](#page-80-0) [rVals](#page-80-0)["](#page-80-0)).

## <span id="page-226-0"></span>**18.20. Asset Reference**

## **18.20.1. Description**

This assertion is used to indicate one or more locations where a copy of the asset may be obtained. Such locations shall each be described using an asset reference assertion. The location shall be expressed via a URI. The URI may be to either a single asset or it may reference a directory. In the latter case, it serves to provide the location for a collection of assets, that would be hashed via a [collection data hash.](#page-173-0)

**NOTE**

Expressing a uri provides flexibility to source the asset from web locations or distributed filesystems such as IPFS (see [https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#subdomain](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#subdomain-gateway)[gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#subdomain-gateway) for the latter).

An asset reference assertion shall have a label of c2pa.asset-ref.

The time-stamp within the assertion metadata provides a basis for determining the freshness of the link described as the reference.

### **18.20.2. Schema and Example**

The schema for this type is defined by the asset-ref-map rule in the following [CDDL Definition](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610):

```
;The asset reference assertion (ARA) describes where a copy of the asset may be obtained.
asset-ref-map = {
  "references": [1* ara-reference-block-map]
}
ara-reference-block-map = {
  "reference": ara-reference-uri-map,
  ? "description": tstr, ; Human readable description of the location.
}
ara-reference-uri-map = {
  "uri": tstr, ; URI reference a location where a copy of the asset may be obtained from
```

}

An example in CBOR diagnostic notation [\(RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), clause 8) is shown below:

```
{
  "references": [
  {
  "description": "A copy of the asset on the web",
  "reference": {
  "uri": "https://some.storage.us/foo"
  }
  },
  {
  "description": "A copy of the asset on IPFS",
  "reference": {
  "uri": "ipfs://cid"
  }
  }
  ]
}
```

## <span id="page-227-0"></span>**18.21. Asset Type**

## **18.21.1. Description**

The asset type assertion provides a way to more completely describe an asset, specifically additional context on how to parse or otherwise process it. This assertion allows for specifying an IANA Media Type value and/or additional type information, since many assets have formats that cannot be completely described by a single Media Type value.

The asset type assertion shall have a label of c2pa.asset-type.v2. There shall be at most one asset type assertion in a C2PA Manifest.

**NOTE**

Earlier versions of this specification documented a c2pa.asset-type assertion, which is now deprecated.

If present, the value of the dc:format field shall be the [IANA Media Type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) of the asset.

If present, the value of the types field shall be an array of zero or more maps (asset-type-map) specifying types associated with the asset. The value of the type field in this map shall either come from [Table 11, "Asset type values"](#page-227-1) or use an [entity-specific namespace](#page-29-4) (e.g., com.litware.types.abc), conforming to the syntax defined for assertion labels in [Section 6.2.2, "Label Naming".](#page-30-2) If relevant, the version of the asset (e.g., the version of a dataset or model) can be documented in the version field in the asset-type-map.

**NOTE**

As C2PA is adopted to provide provenance for AI/ML (i.e., artificial intelligence/machine learning) assets in the future, the C2PA Manifest can be embedded in the model and dataset assets, and the asset type assertion used to specify the type of these model and dataset assets.

## **18.21.3. Details on selection of a value for type**

If an asset's exact type is specified in the [IANA registry application type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#application) or [IANA registry text type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#text), including JSON, CSV, and XML types, this information should be included in the asset type assertion dc:format field.

For example, if the asset is a CSV formatted text file, the dc:format field would be text/csv.

An asset type assertion may contain both a Dublin Core format and a C2PA standard or custom asset type to provide additional information about the asset's type. Some existing Dublin Core types that are commonly used in an asset type assertion in combination with other asset types are specified in [Table 12, "Common DC formats"](#page-230-0).

Table 12. Common DC formats

<span id="page-230-0"></span>

| dc:format Value           | Description of Dublin Core Type of the Asset            |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| application/json          | Stored using the JSON format                            |
| application/gzip          | Stored using the GZIP format                            |
| application/vnd.rar       | Stored using the RAR format                             |
| application/zip           | Stored using the ZIP format                             |
| application/octet-stream  | Stored using an arbitrary binary format                 |
| text/csv                  | Stored using the CSV format                             |
| text/plain                | Stored using the plain text format                      |
| text/tab-separated-values | Stored using the tab-separated-values (TSV) text format |
| text/xml                  | Stored using the XML format                             |

[IANA structured suffixes](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-type-structured-suffix/media-type-structured-suffix.xhtml), such as +json and +zip, are also supported in the C2PA Claim's dc:format field to specify additional types.

Some dc:format types are commonly used but are not specified in the [IANA registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). The following dc:format values are valid for C2PA assets, as shown in [Table 13, "Additional formats".](#page-230-1)

Table 13. Additional formats

<span id="page-230-1"></span>

| dc:format Value             | Description of Dublin Core Type of the Asset |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| application/x-hdf5          | Stored using the HDF5 format                 |
| application/x-7z-compressed | Stored using the 7Z format                   |

## <span id="page-231-0"></span>**18.22. Depthmap**

## **18.22.1. Description**

A depthmap assertion provides a 3D description of the scene being captured by a camera. A depthmap assertion may contain a pre-computed [depth map,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_map) or data which can later be used to compute a depth map by downstream ingestion or viewing software (e.g., left/right stereo images).

All depthmap assertions shall have a label that starts with c2pa.depthmap and be followed by a third section that identifies the type of depth map.

C2PA depthmap assertions shall be captured optically, not inferred from a single 2D image via, for example, a machine learning model.

### **18.22.2. GDepth Depthmap**

A GDepth depth map assertion leverages the well-established [GDepth format](https://developers.google.com/depthmap-metadata/reference) to encode a pre-computed depth map.

A GDepth depthmap assertion shall have a label of c2pa.depthmap.GDepth.

The schema for the data stored in this assertion shall always mirror the schema at [https://developers.google.com/](https://developers.google.com/depthmap-metadata/reference) [depthmap-metadata/reference.](https://developers.google.com/depthmap-metadata/reference)

**NOTE**

There are no concerns with splitting up the GDepth data when it grows beyond 64KB, as that limit existed in XMP to accommodate APP1 segment size limitations.

## **18.22.3. Schema and Example**

The schema for this type is defined by the depthmap-gdepth-map rule in the following [CDDL Definition](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610):

```

## <span id="page-236-0"></span>**18.24. External Reference**

## **18.24.1. Description**

There are use cases where storing the data for the assertion remotely, such as in the cloud, is better than embedded inside the asset, and where that data may change over time. For any such cases, it is possible to use a special type of assertion that serves as an external reference to the location of that information. This is in contrast to the [Cloud Data](#page-188-0) assertion, where remote data is hashed and so must be static.

For privacy and reliability reasons, data referenced through an external reference assertion shall be considered optional: their contents shall not be retrieved as part of manifest validation. A validator may retrieve the contents to serve an application-dependent need. The assertion data that is obtained from resolving the location present in an external reference assertion shall be treated as advisory unless independently verified by other means.

[Assertion metadata](#page-142-0) may be included within the externally referenced assertion. It is also possible to store individual 'assertion metadata' assertions remotely, just as with other assertion types.

An external reference assertion shall have a label of c2pa.external-reference.

An external reference assertion shall not refer to an assertion with the label c2pa.hash.data, c2pa.hash.boxes, c2pa.hash.collection.data, c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 (deprecated), c2pa.hash.bmff.v3, c2pa.actions, or c2pa.actions.v2. An external reference assertion shall never be a created assertion, only a gathered assertion.

The value of the location field consists of a valid URI for the referenced location (uri) and a valid IANA media type (content\_type). Additional metadata about the assertion referenced may be described in the optional metadata field. The size of the externally referenced assertion may be communicated within the optional size field. The size field should not be included if the size of the externally referenced data is subject to change.

## **18.24.2. Schema and Example**

The schema for this type is defined by the external-reference-map rule in the following [CDDL Definition:](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610)

```
; Assertion that references assertion data stored externally by URI (no hash)
external-reference-map = {
  "location": unhashed-ext-uri-map, ; specifies the location and type of the remote data
}
```

An example in CBOR diagnostic notation [\(RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), clause 8) is shown below:

```
{
  "label": "c2pa.thumbnail.claim",
  "location": {
  "uri": "https://cdn.example.org/assets/foo",
  "content_type": "application/octet-stream"
  }
}
```

## <span id="page-237-0"></span>**18.25. Session Keys**

### <span id="page-237-1"></span>**18.25.1. Description**

This assertion provides the session keys that are used, as part of a live video workflow based on the "[Section 19.4,](#page-242-0) ["Verifiable Segment Info method""](#page-242-0), to sign the verifiable-segment-info-map. Live video workflows that rely solely on the ["Section 19.3, "Per-segment C2PA Manifest Box method""](#page-241-0) are not required to use this assertion.

### **18.25.2. Requirements**

A session keys assertion shall have a label of c2pa.session-keys, and a C2PA Manifest may contain at most one session keys assertion.

The session keys assertion consists of a CBOR map (defined as a session-keys-data) and shall contain the following fields:

#### **keys**

An array of one or more session key objects.

Each session key in the keys array is represented as an object containing the following fields:

#### **key**

A COSE key that shall include a kid (key identifier) to ensure that the keys can be uniquely identified.

#### **minSequenceNumber**

An unsigned integer representing the earliest sequence number that can be signed with this key.

#### **createdAt**

The timestamp indicating when the session key was created formatted as CBOR tag 0 (RFC 3339 date-time).

#### **validityPeriod**

An unsigned integer representing the validity period of the session keys in seconds, starting from the createdAt timestamp

#### **signerBinding**

A detached signature of the Signer's end-entity certificate, signed using the (private key) of the session key key, enabling verification that this session key used to protect the media is uniquely associated with the Signer. The payload of Sig\_structure shall be the Signer's end-entity certificate (the first certificate in the x5chain header parameter, as defined in [Section 14.5, "X.509 Certificates"](#page-75-0) ) encoded as a CBOR byte string.

Session keys are valid from their individual createdAt until createdAt + validityPeriod, and shall only be used within their validity period. The minSequenceNumber field indicates the earliest segment sequence number that can be signed with a given key, supporting key rotation and preventing replay attacks.

When providing an new C2PA Manifest (via a C2PA Manifest Box), new session keys may be included in that C2PA Manifest. The new session keys may have overlapping validity periods with previous session keys, but the minSequenceNumber for the new keys shall be greater than or equal to the current sequence number. This ensures a clear transition between keys and supports overlap for seamless key rotation.

## **18.25.3. Schema and Example**

The schema for this type is defined by the session-keys-data rule in the following [CDDL Definition](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610):

```
; Data structure to supply session keys used for live-video validation
session-keys-data = {
  "keys" => [1* session-key], ; one or more session keys 
}
session-key = {
  "key" => COSE_Key, ; session key used to sign the `verifiable-segment-
info-map`, note: semantics need to require kid in COSE_Key
  "minSequenceNumber" => uint ; minimum sequence number that can be signed with this
key
  "createdAt" => #6.0(tstr), ; CBOR tag 0 (RFC 3339 date-time)
  "validityPeriod" => uint, ; seconds from createdAt, key is valid for this period
between createdAt and createdAt + validityPeriod
  "signerBinding" => COSE_Sign1, ; A signature of the Signer's end-entity
certificate, using the session key `key`, enabling verification that the session key is
associated with this Signer
}
```

# <span id="page-240-0"></span>**Chapter 19. Live Video**

## <span id="page-240-1"></span>**19.1. Introduction**

The C2PA Live Video specification is designed to support the unique requirements of live video workflows, where content is created and distributed in real-time. This specification outlines how to manage assertions related to tracks (video, audio, subtitles, etc) in live sessions, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the content as it is produced and shared.

This version of the specification applies to content packaged using the [ISO BMFF](https://www.iso.org/standard/83102.html) standard, while being agnostic of manifest and delivery protocols. It also applies to [CMAF](https://www.iso.org/standard/85623.html) content, which is a constrained subset of ISO BMFF optimized for adaptive streaming.

**NOTE** It does not support [MPEG Transport Streams](https://www.iso.org/standard/91403.html).

## <span id="page-240-2"></span>**19.2. Architecture**

## <span id="page-240-3"></span>**19.2.1. C2PA Manifest transport**

The live video architecture builds upon this specification's support for BMFF-based asset embedding, adding mechanisms to support real-time content validation. The two key parts of that are (1) any hashing of content shall be done using a standard bmff-hash-map (where the target of the hash is a segment) and (2) anytime that a C2PA Manifest Store is included in a live video stream, it shall be incorporated into a uuid box as described in [Section A.5.1,](#page-259-1) ["The](#page-259-1) ['uuid'](#page-259-1) [Box for C2PA"](#page-259-1) (as that is the standard location for a C2PA Manifest Store in BMFF content).

For live video content, the uuid box containing a C2PA Manifest Store may also be present in any segment. This box will be referred to as the "C2PA Manifest Box" in the context of live video.

## **19.2.2. Segment-based validation**

Due to the necessity to validate each segment of the live video stream independently from each other, the hash of each segment's content needs to be provided as part of that segment. Two different methods for signing that information are described, enabling a given claim generator to choose the most appropriate one for its needs. Either method can be used, and validators are not required to support both.

These methods are:

- "[Section 19.3, "Per-segment C2PA Manifest Box method""](#page-241-0) which uses a standard C2PA Manifest Box in each segment.
- "[Section 19.4, "Verifiable Segment Info method""](#page-242-0) which uses a verifiable-segment-info, carried in an emsg box, along with session keys.

Other C2PA-defined live video binding schemes (for example, anchor-point-based schemes that derive per-segment

validation values by chaining across segments) may also be used, provided that they (a) compute segment hashes using a standard bmff-hash-map as defined by this specification and (b) embed or reference a C2PA Manifest Store using a uuid box as described in [Section A.5.1, "The](#page-259-1) ['uuid'](#page-259-1) [Box for C2PA".](#page-259-1)

### **19.2.3. C2PA Manifest binding in an initialization segment**

For those use cases that require (or desire) the presence of an initialization segment, it shall contain a uuid box, whose bmff-hash-map includes the moov box to establish a cryptographic relationship between the initialization segment and the media segments.

**NOTE**

The reason for this binding is to ensure that the C2PA Manifest corresponds to the specific media content, which prevents replay attacks and content substitution.

## <span id="page-241-0"></span>**19.3. Per-segment C2PA Manifest Box method**

## **19.3.1. Description**

A live video stream may use per-segment C2PA Manifest Boxes to provide per-segment validation. When using this approach, each media segment shall contain a C2PA Manifest Box carried in a uuid box as defined in [Section A.5.1,](#page-259-1) ["The](#page-259-1) ['uuid'](#page-259-1) [Box for C2PA".](#page-259-1) The active C2PA Manifest for each segment shall contain a BMFF hash assertion (c2pa.hash.bmff.v3) that covers the bytes of that segment, a [Section 19.3.2, "Live Video Segment Assertion"](#page-241-1) and may also contain any other assertions relevant to that segment.

Claim generators may derive additional per-segment validation values (e.g., anchor-point-based chaining values) from segment hashes and embed them in the Manifest.

**NOTE**

This method does not require session keys, verifiable-segment-info-map, or emsg boxes, and can be used independently of the [Section 19.4, "Verifiable Segment Info method"](#page-242-0).

## <span id="page-241-1"></span>**19.3.2. Live Video Segment Assertion**

When using the per-segment C2PA Manifest Box method, a live video segment assertion shall be included in the C2PA Manifest of each segment. This assertion, which provides metadata about the segment and its relationship to the live video stream, shall have a label of c2pa.livevideo.segment.

The live video segment assertion shall contain a sequenceNumber field that provides a unique identifier for the segment. It shall also contain a streamId field that provides a unique identifier for the entire live video stream.

**NOTE**

The value of streamId can be any string that uniquely identifies the live video stream, such as a UUID or a URL.

While each segment is validated independently, it is important to maintain the continuity of the live video stream. To facilitate this, the live video segment assertion shall contain a continuityMethod field that indicates the method used to ensure continuity between segments, through the use of cryptographic links between adjacent segments.

This specification only defines a single value at this time - c2pa.manifestId - which indicates that the continuity is ensured by matching the previousManifestId field (to the previous segment's C2PA Manifest). Implementers may define additional continuity methods and shall use a label as described in [Section 6.2, "Labels"](#page-29-2) to identify them.

When using the c2pa.manifestId continuity method, the live video segment assertion shall contain a previousManifestId field that provides the manifest identifier of the previous segment's C2PA Manifest (described in the livevideo-segment-map-manifestId rule). Other continuity methods may add additional fields as needed, provided the fields are also named as described in [Section 6.2, "Labels"](#page-29-2).

#### **19.3.2.1. Schema and Example**

The schema for this type is defined by the livevideo-segment-map rule in the following [CDDL Definition:](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610)

```
; assertion used to carry live video segment information
; this assertion shares `sequenceNumber` semantics with `verifiable-segment-info-map`
livevideo-segment-map = {
  "sequenceNumber" => uint, ; monotonically increasing sequence number
for each segment
  "streamId" => tstr, ; A unique "streamId" identifying the live
video stream
  "continuityMethod" => tstr, ; method used to ensure continuity between
segments 
  * tstr => any ; additional fields as needed
}
; when continuityMethod == c2pa.manifestId, additional fields include:
livevideo-segment-map-manifestId = {
  "previousManifestId" => tstr, ; <<manifest-identifier>> of the previous
segment's C2PA Manifest
}
```

An example in CBOR diagnostic notation [\(RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), clause 8) is shown below:

```
{
  "sequenceNumber": 175,
  "streamId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "continuityMethod": "c2pa.manifestId",
  "previousManifestId": "urn:c2pa:F9168C5E-CEB2-4FAA-B6BF-329BF39FA1E4"
}
```

## <span id="page-242-0"></span>**19.4. Verifiable Segment Info method**

## **19.4.1. Description**

The Verifiable Segment Info Map (verifiable-segment-info) is a structure designed to provide concise persegment information for a live video stream allowing for each segment to be validated independently. It enables the validation of each segment's integrity and authenticity during playback, ensuring that the content has not been tampered with. It is used in workflows which are using [Section 19.4.4, "Session Keys"](#page-244-0) to sign the segment information. A verifiable-segment-info is a COSE\_Sign1\_Tagged structure where the payload field is the CBOR serialized segment-info-map. The payload shall be present and shall not be detached. The signature is created by a private [session key.](#page-244-0) The protected header shall carry the identifier of the algorithm used for the signature (alg field) and optionally, a timestamp representing "claimed time of signing" for the segment (iat field, [RFC 8392](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8392)). The unprotected header shall carry the identifier of the session key (kid field).

A segment-info-map shall contain the following fields:

#### **sequenceNumber**

A unique identifier for the segment that is used to ensure the content order. This value shall either match the mfhd.sequence\_number field defined in ISO/IEC 14496-12 or shall follow the segment-indexing rules defined in ISO/IEC 23009-9, Section 6.2 (conditions (a) and (f)). When used in conjunction with the per-segment C2PA Manifest Box method, the sequenceNumber in the verifiable-segment-info-map shall match the sequenceNumber value in the [Section 19.3.2, "Live Video Segment Assertion".](#page-241-1)

**NOTE**

These both provide for the sequence number to increase by 1 for each subsequent segment, while not decreasing or repeating.

#### **manifestId**

A unique identifier for the manifest as described in [Section 8.1, "Uniquely Identifying C2PA Manifests and Assets"](#page-35-1). This is either the identifier of the manifest included in the current segment (via uuid box), or the identifier of the manifest referenced by manifestUrl, or the identifier of the manifest included in a previous segment (including an init segment) that is still the active manifest.

#### **bmffHash**

A C2PA bmff-hash-map that shall contain the hash of the segment (as described in [Section 18.6.2, "Hash](#page-151-0) [Computation"](#page-151-0)), excluding all the C2PA emsg boxes (i.e., all emsg boxes with the scheme\_id\_uri [described](#page-244-1) [above](#page-244-1)). The merkle field shall be absent.

In order to exclude the C2PA emsg boxes, bmffHash shall at least contain one exclusion-map with:

- xpath set to "/emsg".
- data set with offset field equal to 0 and the value field set to urn:c2pa:verifiable-segmentinfo.

A segment-info-map may also contain the following optional field:

#### **manifestUri (optional)**

A hashed-ext-uri that contains a URL from which a C2PA Manifest can be retrieved.

## **19.4.2. Use in an emsg box**

When using the verifiable-segment-info in a live video workflow, a verifiable-segment-info shall be present in the emsg box of each segment of a live video stream to verify the integrity of the content during playback.

**NOTE**

This requirement applies only to workflows that chose the verifiable-segment-info method and does not apply to workflows that rely solely on C2PA Manifest Boxes embedded in each segment.

<span id="page-244-1"></span>The C2PA emsg box fields shall have:

- version set to 0
- scheme\_id\_uri set to urn:c2pa:verifiable-segment-info
- value set to "fseg"
- presentation\_time\_delta set to 0
- timescale and event\_duration set to cover the whole segment
- id set to a session-unique value
- message\_data set to the encoded verifiable-segment-info

#### Example 17. CDDL for verifiable-segment-info

```
verifiable-segment-info = COSE_Sign1_Tagged
; The protected header contains the signature algorithm ('alg')
; and optionally the "claimed time of signing" ('iat').
; The unprotected header contains the the identifier of the session key ('kid').
; The payload is set to the CBOR serialized `segment-info-map`.
segment-info-map = {
  "sequenceNumber" => uint, ; monotonically increasing sequence number
for each segment
  "bmffHash" => bmff-hash-map, ; C2PA c2pa.hash.bmff.v3
  "manifestId" => tstr, ; shall be as described in <<manifest-
identifier>>
  ? "manifestUri" => hashed-ext-uri-map ; optional hashed-ext-uri-map to where
manifest can be retrieved
}
```

## **19.4.3. C2PA Manifest Updates**

When different assertions are required for a new segment (for example, to indicate different provenance or replace expiring session keys), a new C2PA Manifest Store shall be provided, either embedded in the segment via a C2PA Manifest Box or linked externally.

**NOTE**

This allows for dynamic updates to the C2PA Manifest information while maintaining the integrity and authenticity of the content.

### <span id="page-244-0"></span>**19.4.4. Session Keys**

### **19.4.4.1. Description**

Session keys are asymmetric key pairs. Any of the cryptographic algorithms allowed for [claim generator X.509](#page-77-0)

[certificates](#page-77-0) may be used.

When using session-specific keys, they shall be generated at the start of a live video session, but may also be generated and delivered via updated manifests in later segments (either initialization or other segments). Each session key is used for a limited period, which enables key rotation. Session-specific keys should be updated when the provenance changes.

The public halves of the session keys are delivered inside a C2PA Manifest. The initial set of keys shall be part of the C2PA Manifest included in the initialization segment. Session keys may also be retrieved from additional initialization segments, from the active C2PA Manifest included in a [C2PA Manifest Box](#page-240-3), or from the manifestUri included in a verifiable-segment-info. If a receiver finds a verifiable-segment-info signed with a session key not yet known to the receiver, the receiver should extract updated session keys from the manifest carried in the [C2PA](#page-240-3) [Manifest Box](#page-240-3), if present. If no [C2PA Manifest Box](#page-240-3) is present in the segment, then the receiver should attempt to retrieve a C2PA Manifest Store from the URL specified in the manifestUri field of the verifiable-segmentinfo, if present (see [Section 11.4, "External Manifests"\)](#page-64-1). If no C2PA Manifest is present in the current segment, the receiver shall look in the C2PA Manifest that accompanied the initialization segment. After retrieving the C2PA Manifest, the receiver shall ensure that its manifest identifier matches the one provided in the manifestId field of the verifiable-segment-info.

**IMPORTANT**

When using an externally hosted C2PA Manifest that is provided via a manifestUri in a verifiable-segment-info, that C2PA Manifest needs to exist at that URI for the entire period of time that the content is provided.

#### **19.4.4.2. Session Keys Assertion**

A session keys assertion is used to carry one or more public session keys inside a C2PA Manifest. The session keys assertion is described in [Session Keys Assertion](#page-237-1).

## <span id="page-245-0"></span>**19.5. Live Video Architecture Diagram**

[Figure 19, "Live Video Architecture"](#page-246-1) shows the general scheme of all the various data structures that can be used in a live video workflow and how each is connected to the others.

<span id="page-246-1"></span>![](_page_246_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 19. Live Video Architecture

## <span id="page-246-0"></span>**19.6. Live Video Generation Process**

## **19.6.1. Per-segment C2PA Manifest Box method**

When using the per-segment C2PA Manifest Box method, the C2PA Manifest of each segment is constructed in the same way that is described in [Section A.5, "Embedding manifests into BMFF-based assets",](#page-259-0) but with the bmffhash-map only hashing the bytes of that segment. In addition, a [Section 19.3.2, "Live Video Segment Assertion"](#page-241-1) shall be included in the manifest to provide metadata about the segment.

## **19.6.2. Verifiable Segment Info method**

When using the Verifiable Segment Info method, there are two main steps involved in generating the live video stream.

#### **Session Key Generation**

At the start of a live video session, one or more session keys are generated, each with its own createdAt, validityPeriod, and minSequenceNumber. These session keys are included in the C2PA Manifest in the C2PA Manifest Box that shall be present in the initialization segment(s). The minSequenceNumber for each key indicates the earliest segment that should be signed with that key, ensuring a clear transition between keys and supporting overlap for seamless key rotation.

**NOTE**

For limited-duration live video streams, a single session key could be sufficient. For longer live video streams (e.g., 24/7 streams), session keys are rotated periodically by delivering new session keys in subsequent initialization segments before the old session keys expire.

#### **Signing the Box Hash**

Each segment of a live video stream shall have an emsg box containing the verifiable-segment-info, which is a segment-info-map signed by a session key. The segment-info-map carries a sequenceNumber to address out-of-order attacks, and carries a bmff-hash-map that hashes the content in the segment. When manifests change during the live video stream, the updated manifest may be included in a C2PA Manifest Box in the segment or referenced via the manifestUri of the segment-info-map.

## <span id="page-247-0"></span>**19.7. Live Video Validation Process**

## **19.7.1. Initial/Common Validation Steps**

If the segment being validated is an initialization segment, the validator shall look for the presence of an mdat box. If an mdat box is found, the validation shall fail with a failure code of livevideo.init.invalid.

If a segment contains neither a C2PA Manifest Box nor an emsg box that meets the requirements [defined above](#page-244-1), the validation of that segment shall fail with a failure code of livevideo.segment.invalid.

If a C2PA Manifest Box is found in a given segment, it shall be validated according to the general C2PA validation rules described in [Chapter 15,](#page-82-0) [Validation](#page-82-0). If the C2PA Manifest fails validation, the validation of that segment shall fail with a failure code of livevideo.manifest.invalid.

## **19.7.2. Per-segment C2PA Manifest Box Validation**

If the C2PA Manifest present in the C2PA Manifest Box contains a live video segment assertion, the validator shall perform the following tests:

- Ensure that the sequenceNumber field in the live video segment assertion is greater than the previous segment's sequenceNumber (if any). If it is not, the validation of that segment shall fail with a failure code of livevideo.assertion.invalid.
- Ensure that the streamId field in the live video segment assertion matches the streamId from the previous segment (if any). If they do not match, the validation of that segment shall fail with a failure code of livevideo.assertion.invalid.
- Ensure that the continuityMethod field is present in the live video segment assertion. If it is not, the validation of that segment shall fail with a failure code of livevideo.continuityMethod.invalid.
- If the continuityMethod field in the live video segment assertion has a value of "c2pa.manifestId", then the live video segment assertion shall contain a previousManifestId field. If it does not, the validation of that segment shall fail with a failure code of livevideo.continuityMethod.invalid. If it does, then ensure that its value matches the manifestId of the previous segment's C2PA Manifest. If they do not match, the validation of that segment shall fail with a failure code of livevideo.segment.invalid.
- If the continuityMethod field in the live video segment assertion has a value other than "c2pa.manifestId", and the validator does not recognize or support that continuity method, the validation of that segment shall fail with a failure code of livevideo.continuityMethod.invalid.

## **19.7.3. Verifiable Segment Info Validation**

If the C2PA Manifest present in the C2PA Manifest Box contains a session keys assertion, the public session keys shall be extracted and stored for use in validating subsequent segments. If any public session key does not conform to the requirements described in [Session Keys Assertion,](#page-237-1) the validation of that segment shall fail with a failure code of livevideo.sessionkey.invalid. Similarly, if signature validation (signerBinding) of any public session key structure fails, that session key is invalid and shall not be used to validate any media segment, and validation shall fail with a failure code of livevideo.sessionkey.invalid.

If a segment contains an emsg box that meets the requirements [defined above](#page-244-1), and the segment is not an initialization segment, and the validator does not have any valid session keys, the validation of that segment shall fail with a failure code of livevideo.segment.invalid.

If there is a valid emsg box containing a valid verifiable-segment-info, the validator shall extract the value of kid from its unprotected header and use that to identify the correct public session key. If such key is not available, and if the manifestUri field is present, the validator retrieves and verifies the applicable manifest, extracting the public session key(s) as explained above.

**NOTE**

There may not be valid session keys for a variety of reasons including (but not limited to) if the initialization segment containing the session keys assertion was not received, if a C2PA Manifest (containing the session keys) failed validation, or if the keys have expired.

Validation fails if the key cannot be found or if the signature in verifiable-segment-info cannot be verified with it, and shall fail with a failure code of livevideo.segment.invalid.

Subsequently, when parsing the segment-info-map, validation of that segment shall fail with a failure code of

#### livevideo.segment.invalid if any of the following errors occurs:

- the segment's sequenceNumber is lower than the minSequenceNumber (of the matching session key);
- the segment's presentation time is outside the key's validity period;
- the segment's hash does not match the bmffHash field (see [Section 18.6, "BMFF-Based Hash"](#page-150-0)).

To address the risk of the Claim Generator's certificate getting revoked during a very long lived session, the validator should check that the certificate used to sign the C2PA Manifest from which the current session key was retrieved is still valid. If it is not, the validation of that segment shall fail with a failure code of livevideo.sessionkey.invalid.

# <span id="page-250-0"></span>**Chapter 20. Patent Policy**

## <span id="page-253-0"></span>**A.2. Embedding manifests in multi-part assets**

When embedding a C2PA Manifest into a multi-part asset ("multi-asset"), there shall be a C2PA Manifest Store embedded into the primary part of the asset (which contains the active manifest), though additional parts may also contain their own C2PA Manifest Stores. The active manifest of the primary part shall contain a [multi-asset hash](#page-176-0) [assertion](#page-176-0) that describes the location and hash of each part within the asset and should describe the provenance of the whole multi-part asset.

## <span id="page-253-1"></span>**A.3. Embedding manifests into non-BMFF-based assets**

## <span id="page-253-2"></span>**A.3.1. Embedding manifests into JPEG**

The C2PA Manifest Store shall be embedded as the data contained in an **APP11** marker segment as defined in [JPEG](https://www.iso.org/standard/66071.html) [XT, ISO/IEC 18477-3.](https://www.iso.org/standard/66071.html)

Since a single marker segment in JPEG 1 cannot be larger than 64K bytes, it is likely that multiple **APP11** segments will be required, and they shall be constructed as per the JPEG 1 standard and ISO 19566-5:2023, D.2. When writing multiple segments, they shall be written in sequential order, and they shall be contiguous (i.e., one segment immediately following the next).

## <span id="page-253-3"></span>**A.3.2. Embedding manifests into PNG**

The C2PA Manifest Store shall be embedded using an ancillary, private, not safe to copy, chunk type of 'caBX' (as per [PNG, 4.7.2\)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-PNG-20031110/). It is recommended that the 'caBX' chunk precede the 'IDAT' chunks.

**NOTE**

Although PNG supports it, it's considered bad-form to have a data block after the 'IDAT' and before the 'IEND'. (The exception being animated PNG blocks)

## <span id="page-253-4"></span>**A.3.3. Embedding manifests into SVG**

[SVG](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/) is an XML-based format that can exist either stand-alone or embedded into other text-based formats such as HTML. As such, it is necessary to Base64 encode the binary C2PA Manifest Store to perform the embedding. While this section describes how to do that, the use of an [external manifest](#page-64-1) is preferred.

The C2PA Manifest Store shall be embedded as the Base64-encoded value of a c2pa:manifest element in the [metadata](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/metadata.html#MetadataElement) [element](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/metadata.html#MetadataElement) of the SVG. Because XML, and SVG in particular, strongly recommend the declaration of a namespace prior to its use, a xmlns:c2pa = "http://c2pa.org/manifest" attribute declaration should be added to the svg element.

Example 18. Example of a C2PA Manifest Store in an SVG

## <span id="page-254-1"></span>**A.3.4. Embedding manifests into ID3**

The C2PA Manifest Store shall be embedded into a ID3v2-compatible, compressed audio file (e.g., MP3 or FLAC) file as the Encapsulated object data of a General Encapsulated Object (GEOB) as defined in [https://id3.org/id3v2.3.0](https://id3.org/id3v2.3.0#General_encapsulated_object). The GEOB's MIME type field shall be present and shall use the value for the media type for JUMBF as described in [Section 11.4, "External Manifests".](#page-64-1)

Ogg Vorbis (as described in [RFC 3533\)](http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3533) is an open-source, lossy audio compression format encapsulated within the Ogg multimedia container. The C2PA Manifest Store shall be embedded in its own dedicated logical bitstream within the container. The first packet of this stream starts with the 5-byte identifier \x00c2pa, and the C2PA Manifest Store data follows immediately after.

## <span id="page-254-2"></span>**A.3.6. Embedding manifests into TIFF-based assets**

The [Digital Negative or DNG](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/photoshop/pdf/dng_spec_1_6_0_0.pdf) format provides camera manufacturers to provide their camera raw formats in a standardized manner. DNG is based on which is based on [TIFF/EP](https://www.iso.org/standard/29377.html) (which is, itself, based on [TIFF](https://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/com16/tiff-fx/docs/tiff6.pdf)).

The C2PA Manifest Store shall be embedded into a TIFF-compatible file (i.e., TIFF/EP, DNG or other TIFF-based RAW formats) as the data of a tag with ID 52545 (decimal) or 0xCD41 (hexadecimal), with a tag type of 7.

**NOTE**

The value of the ByteOrder field in the TIFF header does not govern the endianness of the embedded C2PA Manifest Store.

Although TIFF supports the concept of multiple pages or layers (via multiple IFD's), there shall only be one C2PA Manifest Store for the entire asset - not one per IFD. As such, the C2PA Manifest Store shall be the only box present in the last IFD (the IFD whose next IFD offset is 0). To support update manifests, the C2PA Manifest Store should be located at the end of the file; this ensures that changes to the size of the C2PA Manifest Store do not impact any of the other tag offsets.

**NOTE**

Previous versions of this specification required the use of IFD 0, but it was recognized that doing so restricted its use in TIFF-based RAW formats.

## <span id="page-255-2"></span>**A.3.7. Embedding manifests into RIFF-based assets**

The [RIFF \(Resource Interchange File Format\)](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000025.shtml) format provides a generic container format for storing data in tagged chunks. It is primarily used to store multimedia such as images, sound and video. It serves as the container format for [WAV,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV) [BWF, Broadcast Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_Wave_Format), [AVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Interleave) and [WebP.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP)

**NOTE** RIFF is based on an older format called [IFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchange_File_Format).

The C2PA Manifest Store shall be embedded into a RIFF-compatible file (i.e., WAV, AVI or WebP) as the data of a chunk with an identifier of C2PA. For compatibility reasons, this C2PA chunk shall appear as the last sub-chunk of the first RIFF header chunk.

## <span id="page-255-1"></span>**A.3.8. Embedding manifests into GIFs**

The C2PA Manifest Store shall be broken into chunks of a size no greater than 255 bytes and embedded into contiguous data sub-blocks (as per [GIF, 15](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt)) within a C2PA-specialised Application Extension block (as per [GIF, 26\)](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt), specified below.

**NOTE**

In this C2PA Application Extension Block, the Application Authentication Code is not used to authenticate the application producing the block. Instead, it is used as a block version, and set initially at major version 1, minor version 0, and is encoded as specified below.

```

As described in ISO/IEC 18181-2:2024, Clause 4, JPEG XL supports two different formats for the data. It may use a box structure that is compatible with JPEG 2000 and JPEG XS or it may be a direct JPEG XL codestream without the box structure. A JPEG XL file that uses the box structure shall contain at most one JUMBF (jumb) superbox (ISO/IEC 18181- 2:2024, Clause 9.3) containing a C2PA Manifest JUMBF Box, which contains the C2PA Manifest as described in [Section](#page-58-2)

Fonts which conform to either [Open Font Format](https://www.iso.org/standard/74461.html) or the [OpenType](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/) specification may include a C2PA table. When present, this table may include an embedded manifest, a remote manifest URI, or both.

The C2PA table format is not yet defined in the [Open Font Format](https://www.iso.org/standard/74461.html) nor [OpenType](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/) specification; the following definition is preliminary:

#### **A.3.10.1. Table Tag**

The C2PA table record will be identified by the following table tag: C2PA.

#### **A.3.10.2. Table Record**

The C2PA table provides full support for a Manifest Stores to be either embedded or remote or both. The table record is defined as follows:

Table 14. C2PA table record

The non-embedded C2PA manifest may be remote or locally on the same storage system. If the reference is a JUMBF URI, it should be a valid reference within the C2PA Manifest Store.

## <span id="page-257-0"></span>**A.4. Embedding manifests into PDFs**

### **A.4.1. General**

All C2PA Manifest Stores shall be embedded using embedded file streams (ISO 32000, 7.11.4). The embedded file specification dictionary shall have a Subtype key whose value is application/c2pa and an AFRelationship key (ISO 32000, 7.11.3) whose value is C2PA\_Manifest. If a C2PA Manifest Store is embedded into an encrypted PDF, the embedded file stream shall use an Identity crypt filter.

### **A.4.2. Document-level Manifests**

#### **A.4.2.1. Adding the Manifest to a PDF**

When adding a C2PA Manifest to the entire PDF, the document catalog dictionary shall contain an AF entry whose value is an indirect reference to the embedded file specification containing the active manifest. That embedded file specification shall also be referenced, via indirect object, either from the EmbeddedFiles NameTree (/Catalog/Names/EmbeddedFiles) or from a FileAttachment annotation. The annotation approach shall be used when adding a C2PA Manifest Store to a PDF that already has an existing PDF certifying signature in order to avoid invalidating its DocMDP restrictions.

**NOTE**

Values of 1 or 2 of the P field in the DocMDP dictionary do not allow this type of modification. Only a value of 3 does.

In most other formats, there only exists a single C2PA Manifest Store that contains all of the C2PA Manifests for the asset. However, because of PDF's "incremental update" feature, it is necessary to instead support multiple manifests in a single PDF. In this scenario, the C2PA Manifest Store found in the base PDF shall be considered the initial manifest and the one in the most recent update, the active manifest. A C2PA Manifest Consumer shall process all C2PA Manifests in all C2PA Manifest Stores as if they were contained in a single C2PA Manifest Store.

**NOTE**

Because a JUMBF URI is always a full URI, meaning that it starts at a given C2PA Manifest, and all C2PA Manifests are considered to be contained in a single C2PA Manifest Store, using such a URI to refer to a parentOf ingredient across C2PA Manifest Stores in a PDF is acceptable.

#### **A.4.2.2. Compatibility with PDF Signatures**

It is necessary to know, when adding a new C2PA Manifest Store, if a PDF signature (certifying or approval) will also be applied. Since the PDF signature will change the data of the PDF after the C2PA Manifest is signed, the size and location of the PDF signature dictionary's Contents key shall be determined before C2PA signing. That range of bytes shall be added to the list of exclusions in the c2pa.hash.data assertion, so that the C2PA signature is not invalidated by the addition of the PDF signature. The PDF signature shall be over the entire PDF, including the associated C2PA Manifest Store.

**NOTE**

Adding the PDF signature in addition to the C2PA's claim signature improves compatibility with the existing PDF ecosystem.

### **A.4.3. Object-level Manifests**

In addition to being able to provide provenance for the PDF itself, via document-level manifests, individual objects within a document may also have an associated C2PA Manifest Store. This is done by adding an AF entry to the object's stream or dictionary. The value of the AF entry shall be an indirect reference to the embedded file specification containing the C2PA Manifest Store, embedded [as described above.](#page-29-1)

The most common uses for this feature are to provide provenance for embedded images - either as Image or Form XObjects and Fonts. It can also be used to provide provenance for specific pieces of content by adding the AF entry to the object (via property list) or a structure element, as described in the Associated Files clause of ISO 32000-2 (14.13.1).

It is recommended that any object-level manifest that is added be referenced from the active manifest as a componentOf ingredient. This will allow the C2PA Manifest Consumer to easily traverse the entire chain of provenance for the asset.

In general, any PDF stream or dictionary may have a C2PA Manifest attached to it as long as the stream or dictionary represents an actual information resource. When there is ambiguity about exactly which stream or dictionary may bear the AF entry, the manifest shall be attached as closely as possible to the object that actually stores the data resource described.

**NOTE**

The C2PA Manifest describing a raster image would be attached to the Image XObject stream describing it, and the manifest for embedded font files would be attached to font file streams rather

## <span id="page-259-0"></span>**A.5. Embedding manifests into BMFF-based assets**

## <span id="page-259-1"></span>**A.5.1. The 'uuid' Box for C2PA**

All BMFF-based C2PA assets, whether they are timed (e.g., videos with or without audio tracks), untimed (e.g., still photos) or mixed (e.g., live or animated photos) audiovisual media, shall use a 'uuid' box that adheres to the following syntax and semantics defined below.

**NOTE**

The reason that a 'uuid' box instead of a 'c2pa' box is being used is that browsers based on Chromium will immediately fail playback when they encounter any unknown top-level boxes.

Some file formats that are BMFF-based and would be supported via this method include:

- MPEG-4 code-points, either complete (.mp4) or fragmented (.m4s); downloadable audio files (.m4a);
- HEIF (.heif, .heic);
- AVIF (.avif).

## **A.5.1.1. Definition**

Box Type: 'uuid'

```
Extended Box Type: 0xD8, 0xFE, 0xC3, 0xD6, 0x1B, 0x0E, 0x48, 0x3C, 0x92, 0x97, 0x58, 0x28,
0x87, 0x7E, 0xC4, 0x81
Container: File
Mandatory: No
Quantity: Zero or more
```

C2PA's 'uuid' box embeds provenance into BMFF. One such box contains a C2PA Manifest Store, and there may be one or more auxiliary boxes containing additional information required for validation.

#### **A.5.1.2. Syntax**

```
aligned(8) class ContentProvenanceBox extends FullBox('uuid', extended_type = 0xD8 0xFE 0xC3
0xD6 0x1B 0x0E 0x48 0x3C 0x92 0x97 0x58 0x28 0x87 0x7E 0xC4 0x81, version = 0, 0) {
  string box_purpose;
  bit(8) data[];
}
```

### **A.5.1.3. Regarding unique IDs**

There are cases, such as fragmented MP4 (fMP4), where the ID for a subset of the asset, such as the track\_id field of the 'tkhd' box, is only locally unique to a subset of the overall asset rather than globally unique to the asset.

Because a globally unique ID is needed to determine what to hash, a unique ID is included. This unique ID does not equal any value from the original asset; each value is instead defined when the manifest is created. The unique ID is then combined with an associated local ID to form an ID that's globally unique to the entire asset.

## **A.5.2. Semantics**

The purpose of each box (box\_purpose) and the fields that depend on it (data) are described below for each box.

## **A.5.3. Box Containing the Manifest**

The box containing the C2PA Manifest Store shall appear before the first 'mdat' box in the file and before any 'moov' box in the file. To accommodate major\_brand and compatible\_brand verification, it shall be placed after the 'ftyp' box. When the active manifest of an asset is an update manifest, the previous standard C2PA Manifest Store is located as indicated above with box\_purpose changed to original. The updated C2PA Manifest Store shall exist as the last box of the file with box\_purpose set to update.

The fields in the corresponding box described above shall be set as follows.

#### **box\_purpose**

For a C2PA Manifest Store, this value shall be manifest, original or update.

#### **data**

When box\_purpose is manifest, the first 8 bytes inside 'data' shall be the absolute file byte offset to the first auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA box with box\_purpose equal to merkle. If this file contains no such boxes, those 8 bytes shall be zero. Those 8 bytes shall be followed by the raw C2PA Manifest Store bytes followed by zero or more unused padding bytes. When box\_purpose is original, that indicates another C2PA box whose box\_purpose value is set to update is present. The 'data' within this original box is unchanged. When box\_purpose is update, the C2PA Manifest Store shall only contain update manifests.

**NOTE**

The 'data' field inside the 'uuid' box of type manifest or original includes the absolute file byte offset, manifest, and padding bytes. The original and manifest boxes are identical apart from value of box\_purpose and as such hash bindings are not changed. No data hashed data is moved by appending 'update' box.

Padding bytes are not permitted outside the 'uuid' box unless they are contained in their own mp4 box such as a 'free' box.

For fragmented MP4 (fMP4) files, for each initialization segment that may be present, an identical 'uuid' C2PA box of type manifest shall be present; the C2PA Manifest Store shall be identical.

## <span id="page-261-0"></span>**A.5.4. Auxiliary 'c2pa' Boxes for Large and Fragmented Files**

#### **A.5.4.1. General**

Some files have one or more very large 'mdat' boxes (e.g., large video or image files which may be downloaded and rendered progressively) or large numbers of independent 'mdat' boxes (e.g., fMP4 where each fragment can be downloaded independently).

In these cases, it is unreasonable to require a client to completely download all 'mdat' box(es) before validating any portion of the asset. Avoiding that necessity is resolved by using multiple hashes.

For each large 'mdat' box, subsets of the box have individual hashes that can be validated independently; how to determine these subsets is specified below. For fMP4 content where each 'mdat' box can be downloaded independently, each fragment has its own individual hash.

In the simplest case, all of these hashes are stored in the active manifest. Each subset has an auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA box that declares how to locate its hash in the active manifest; refer to the note regarding unique IDs above for why this is the case.

However, for sufficiently large assets, including every subset's hash in the manifest itself would increase the size of the C2PA Manifest Store to one or more megabytes.

Avoiding such a large C2PA Manifest Store for a large asset is achieved by using one or more Merkle trees.

- For a large non-fragmented asset that contains one or more 'mdat' boxes in a single large file, one Merkle tree is used for each 'mdat' box.
- For a large fragmented asset that contains a set of 'mdat' boxes for a single track which may be spread across multiple files, one Merkle tree is used for each track.

#### In either case:

- Each leaf node of any given Merkle tree is the subset's hash.
- The manifest stores one row of each Merkle tree.
- The auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA box that exists for each subset indicates which Merkle tree row in the active manifest it requires and which leaf node it represents. It also includes any additional hash(es) from the Merkle tree necessary to derive a hash in the active manifest's Merkle tree row.

The selection of which Merkle tree row to store in the manifest creates a size tradeoff within the asset. Specifically, storing a single hash per Merkle tree in the manifest minimizes the size of the manifest but requires log2(subsets) to be stored in each subset-specific box. Each time the number of hashes stored in the manifest for a Merkle tree is doubled (by moving "down" one Merkle tree row), the number of hashes stored in each subset-specific box decreases by one. Thus, increasing the size of the manifest decreases the size of the entire asset and vice-versa, and since hashes for individual subsets are replicated across subsets as required to derive a manifest-specified hash, the tradeoff is not 1 to 1.

Making this size tradeoff is left up to the implementation creating the manifest; this spec neither mandates nor recommends that any specific Merkle tree row be stored in the manifest. That said, because the simplest case of storing all subset hashes in the manifest is equivalent to using a Merkle tree where the leaf nodes are stored in the manifest, the same Merkle tree construction is used for multiple hashes in all cases. That construction is defined as follows.

The portion of the manifest containing the BMFF Hash shall include the merkle field. Refer to [Section 9.2.3, "Hashing](#page-41-3) [a BMFF-formatted asset"](#page-41-3) for more information.

#### **A.5.4.1.1. Non-fragmented asset that can be validated piecewise**

If the manifest contains a non-leaf row of the merkle tree, two or more auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA boxes with box\_purpose set to 'merkle' as described below shall be included in the file. They are not required to be included in the file if the manifest contains the leaf row of the merkle tree. If they exists, they shall follow the last 'mdat' box in the file.

The hash used for a given leaf node in the merkle tree shall be computed from the subset of payload of the 'mdat'. The 'mdat' is divided into sizes defined by 'fixedBlockSize' or the array of 'variableBlockSizes' found in the merkle-map, and sum of the 'variableBlockSizes' shall be equal to size of the 'mdat' payload.

All such auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA boxes shall meet the following requirements.

- They shall be in the same sequence as the subsets they hash as specified by the 'variableBlockSizes' field.
- They shall be grouped such that a single merkle tree's auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA boxes are sequential with no intervening boxes.
- The location value in the first box shall be set to 0, in the second box shall be set to 1, and shall increase sequentially thereafter.

#### **A.5.4.1.2. Fragmented asset**

For fMP4 assets which are split across multiple files:

- One auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA box with box\_purpose set to 'merkle' as described below shall be included in each fragment file immediately preceding the 'moof' box.
- The hash used for a given leaf node in the Merkle tree shall be over all data in its containing single fragment file except data excluded by the exclusion list.

**NOTE**

This specification does not enable support for fMP4 assets which are split across multiple files where individual fragment files contain more than one 'moof' box or 'mdat' box or both.

For fMP4 assets which are stored as a single flat MP4 file with a single 'moov' for all tracks and then one 'moof' /'mdat' pair for each fragment:

- One auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA box with box\_purpose set to 'merkle' as described below shall be included immediately preceding each 'moof' box.
- The hash used for a given leaf node in the Merkle tree shall be over that 'moof' box plus all data preceding the next 'moof' box or over all data through the end of the file if there is no further 'moof' box. The hash shall not cover data excluded by the exclusion list.

### **IMPORTANT**

Taking a C2PA-compliant fMP4 asset which is split across multiple files (i.e., has 'c2pa' boxes of types 'manifest' and 'merkle') and appending the individual files together will not produce a single file which is C2PA-compliant (nor vice-versa). This is because which boxes are included in each 'merkle' hash will be different in the two cases. If both forms are desirable, the second form shall consider the first form as an ingredient and the new manifest shall include both an ingredient assertion with relationship parentOf and an actions assertion that includes an action of type c2pa.repackaged.

#### **A.5.4.1.3. Live video fragmented asset**

For fMP4 assets which are live video transmissions follow the instructions [here](#page-240-0).

#### **A.5.4.1.4. Box containing the merkle auxiliary**

Regardless of how the asset is structured, the fields in the corresponding box described above shall be set as follows.

#### **box\_purpose**

For an auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA box, this value shall be merkle.

## **data**

When box\_purpose is merkle, this value shall contain raw CBOR bytes indicating how to validate a portion of the asset as defined as follows. If there are multiple auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA boxes with box\_purpose merkle for a given Merkle tree in a single file, each shall be followed by sufficient padding bytes (zero or more) to make all auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA boxes for that Merkle tree a fixed size.

**NOTE**

When there are more than one of these boxes in a single file, i.e., the case where there are large 'mdat'(s) being validated piecemeal, a fixed size is needed in order to enable a progressively downloading client to only download the boxes it needs to begin validation rather than the entire Merkle tree. Such a client can download enough of the first of these boxes based on the absolute file byte offset in the active manifest to determine if its uniqueId and localId match the 'mdat' it is trying to validate. If they do, it can determine the absolute file byte offset to the box it needs to validate by multiplying the subset number by that size then download just that box. Otherwise, it can determine the absolute file byte offset to the beginning of the next Merkle tree by multiplying that fixed size by the current Merkle tree's total number of leaf nodes, and it can repeat this process until it locates the box it needs. The total download size for this subset of boxes is very small relative to the size of a single subset.

#### **A.5.4.2. Schema and Example**

The schema for this type is defined by the bmff-merkle-map rule in the following [CDDL Definition:](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610)

```
; The data structure used to store sufficient information to validate a single 'mdat' box or
; a portion of an 'mdat' box when a Merkle tree is used",
bmff-merkle-map = {
  "uniqueId": int, ; A unique integer used to differentiate local ids
  "localId": int, ; A local id indicating Merkle tree.
  "location": int, ; Zero-based index into the leaf-most Merkle tree row corresponding to
this 'mdat' box or portion of this 'mdat' box
  ? "hashes": [1* bstr], ; An ordered array representing the set of additional hashes
required to reach a hash in the Merkle tree specified in the manifest from leaf-most (peer
of this node) to root-most (child of node in manifest). Note that this array may not be
present, e.g. if the manifest itself contains the leaf-most row of the Merkle tree. Null
hashes are not included in this array. The algorithm used is determined using the `alg`
field from the corresponding entry in the `merkle` field array in the BMFF hash structure.
}
```

An example in CBOR diagnostic notation [\(RFC 8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949), clause 8) is shown below:

```
{
  "hashes": [
  b64'TWVub3JhaA=='
  ],
  "localId": 4402,
  "location": 2203,
  "uniqueId": 1339
}
```

For non-fragmented asset, the localId field in the bmff-merkle-map shall indicate the 'mdat' box. This is a zero-based index indicating the order of 'mdat' within the file. For fragmented asset, the localId field in the bmffmerkle-map shall be set to the track\_id field of the 'tkhd' box pertaining to the 'mdat' being hashed.

## **A.5.5. Dynamic stream generation**

Many adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) implementations store a single version of an asset, e.g., as a flat MP4 or in another intermediate format, and generate individual asset streams using various codecs, bitrates, etc. at consumption time. As a result, such a server shall either hash said streams and create a C2PA Manifest each time the content is consumed or, if generation is deterministic, create and cache the hashes and C2PA Manifests once and then embed them at consumption time.

### <span id="page-265-0"></span>**A.5.6. Exclusion List Requirements**

For all c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 (deprecated) and c2pa.hash.bmff.v3 assertions, the entries in [Example 19,](#page-265-1) ["Always excluded boxes"](#page-265-1) shall always appear on the exclusion list. Other entries are allowed but not required.

The entire 'uuid' C2PA box shall be excluded. (The 'data' field is ensuring that other 'uuid' boxes are not excluded.)

<span id="page-265-1"></span>Example 19. Always excluded boxes

```
xpath = "/uuid"
 data = [ { offset = 8, data = b64'2P7D1hsOSDySl1goh37EgQ==' } ]
The entire 'ftyp' and 'mfra' boxes shall be excluded.
 xpath = "/ftyp"
 xpath = "/mfra"
```

**NOTE**

Previous versions of this specification included additional mandatory exclusions, but it was discovered that excluding them is insecure.

For all c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 (deprecated) and c2pa.hash.bmff.v3 assertions where the bmff-hash-map includes both the hash field and merkle fields, the entry in [Example 20, "Additional always excluded boxes"](#page-265-2) shall appear on the exclusion list.

<span id="page-265-2"></span>Example 20. Additional always excluded boxes

```
xpath = "/mdat"
subset = { { 16, 0 } }
```

**NOTE**

As indicated in the CDDL Definition above, the c2pa.hash.bmff assertion excludes the entire 'mdat' box in this case, but it was discovered that excluding it is insecure.

As indicated in the CDDL Definition above, a relative byte offset or relative byte offset plus length that exceeds the length of the box is permitted; bytes beyond the end of the box shall never bed hashed. For example, if the mdat box is only 12 bytes long, all of it is hashed and the aforementioned mandatory exclusion entry has no effect although it is still required.

## **A.5.7. Timed-media streams that are neither audio nor video**

Timed-media streams that are neither audio nor video, such as text streams for captions, that the claim generator wishes to make tamper evident shall be handled the same way as audio and video streams.

## **A.5.8. External references**

Externally referenced content declared inside BMFF boxes, such as in a 'dref', 'url', or 'urn' box, that the claim generator wishes to make tamper evident shall **not** exclude the referencing box and shall include a separate [cloud data assertion](#page-188-0) for each external reference to be hashed.

## **A.5.9. Size requirements**

If a BMFF-based asset uses 32-bit sizes or offsets in any box(es), e.g. the 'stco' box, and adding boxes to conform to this specification will push the file size over 4 gigabytes, it is the responsibility of the manifest creator to edit the file to use appropriate sizes and offsets, e.g. by replacing the 'stco' box with a 'co64' box, before creating the manifest.

## <span id="page-266-0"></span>**A.6. Embedding manifests into ZIP-based formats**

### **A.6.1. General**

Because of its longevity and being an [openly published specification](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT), many command file formats are really ZIP archives, but with a specific organization of the content files. This includes formats such as [EPUB](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/), [Office Open XML](https://www.iso.org/standard/61796.html), [Open Document](https://www.iso.org/standard/66376.html) and [OpenXPS.](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-376/)

## **A.6.2. Hashing**

#### **A.6.2.1. Hashing the Files**

A ZIP-based file format shall be hashed using a [collection data hash](#page-173-0), where each file contained in the ZIP (except the C2PA Manifest itself) shall be included. The hash of each file in the collection is computed over the file's local file header followed by the compressed and/or encrypted content, and any data description if present. The hash algorithm used shall be specified in the alg field of the [collection data hash](#page-173-0) structure.

**NOTE**

The reason that the hash is over the compressed/encrypted content is to enable validation without the need to decompress or have the decryption key. This is important for formats that can be encrypted, such as EPUB.

#### <span id="page-267-0"></span>**A.6.2.2. Hashing the ZIP Central Directory**

As described in 4.3.12 of the ZIP AppNote, the Central Directory is an array of central directory headers - one per file in the ZIP archive. It is stored at the end of the ZIP archive and used to locate the files in the ZIP archive and necessary information/metadata about them. It is immediately followed by the End of Central Directory record (ZIP AppNote, 4.3.16), which contains information about the ZIP archive itself.

In order to prevent tampering with the ZIP Central Directory, such as adding new files or modifying information about the existing files, each "central directory header" in the ZIP Central Directory as well as the the "end of central directory record" shall be hashed. The hash is computed using the hash algorithm specified in the alg field of the [collection data hash](#page-173-0) structure. The hash shall be computed by sequentially processing each "central directory header" in its entirety, except for the one that contains the C2PA Manifest Store file, where its crc-32 field shall be skipped. Following the processing of the "central directory headers", the hash shall also include the entire "end of central directory record".

## **NOTE**

We cannot compute and set a valid CRC32 for the manifest without hashing it, but that can't happen until it is complete, which can't happen until the collection data hash has been computed.

The resultant hash value shall be stored in the zip\_central\_directory\_hash field of the [collection data hash](#page-173-0) structure.

### **NOTE**

Using a specially named file in the list of files was considered, but was not accepted because of the two-pass scenario described below.

```
; An array of URIs and their associated hashes
$collection-data-hash-map /= {
  "uris": [1* uri-hashed-data-map],
  "alg": tstr .size (1..max-tstr-length), ; A string identifying the cryptographic hash
algorithm used to compute the hash on each entry of the `uris` array, taken from the C2PA
hash algorithm identifier list. 
  ? "zip_central_directory_hash" : bstr,
}
; The data structure used to store a reference to a URI and its hash. 
$uri-hashed-data-map /= {
  "uri": relative-url-type, ; relative URI reference
  "hash": bstr, ; byte string containing the hash value
  ? "size": size-type, ; Number of bytes of data
  ? "dc:format": format-string, ; IANA media type of the data
  ? "data_types": [1* $asset-type-map], ; additional information about the data's type
}
; with CBOR Head (#) and tail ($) are introduced in regexp, so not needed explicitly
relative-url-type /= tstr .regexp "[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{2,256}\\.[a-z]{2,6}\\b[-a-zA-Z0-
9@:%_\\+.~#?&//=]*"
```

Because the ZIP file needs to be completed prior to the completion of the C2PA Manifest, a two pass approach (as described for JPEG, BMFF and PDF) shall be used. The first pass creates a ZIP file with a zero-filled content\_credential.c2pa file, and computes the hash of the ZIP Central Directory. The second pass completes the C2PA Manifest including filling the value of the zip\_central\_directory\_hash field.

One possible implementation of this two-pass approach would be:

- create a ZIP with an zero-filled C2PA Manifest Store file (large enough to be replaced);
- compute the hash of the ZIP Central Directory;
- add the hash to the zip\_central\_directory\_hash field of the collection-data-hash-map;
- complete the manifest ;
- overwrite the zero-filled content\_credential.c2pa file with the completed manifest data.

When creating the content\_credential.c2pa file in the ZIP archive, it shall be stored (compression method 0) and not encrypted. Its general purpose bit flag shall be set to 0. The date and time fields may be set to the time of creation of the ZIP archive, or set to 0. It may have a file comment.

## **A.6.3. Placement of the Manifest Store**

The C2PA Manifest Store shall be stored in the META-INF directory of the ZIP archive with a filename of content\_credential.c2pa and a media type as recommended for [external manifests.](#page-64-1) The file shall be stored (compression method 0) and not encrypted.

### **A.6.4. Digitally signing ZIP-based formats**

#### **A.6.4.1. EPUB**

EPUB's digital signatures are based on [W3C XML DigSig Core,](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core1/) where each file that is signed is listed in the <Manifest> element of the <Signature> element. In addition, no support exists for signing the ZIP Central Directory. As such, EPUB native signing shall take place before the introduction of the C2PA Manifest.

#### **A.6.4.2. Office Open XML**

OOXML's digital signatures are based on [W3C XML DigSig Core](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core1/), where each file that is signed is listed as a <Reference> element in the <Manifest> element of the <Signature> element. In addition, no support exists for signing the ZIP Central Directory. As such, OOXML native signing shall take place before the introduction of the C2PA Manifest.

**NOTE**

OpenXPS is based on the same Open Packaging Convention (OPC) standard as OOXML, and as such, the same approach applies.

## <span id="page-268-0"></span>**A.7. Embedding Manifests into Unstructured Text**

## **A.7.1. General**

For unstructured text where traditional file-based embedding is not practical, such as content intended for copypaste operations across different systems, C2PA Manifests may be embedded directly into a Unicode-encoded text stream. This method uses a sequence of Unicode Variation Selectors to encode a C2PA Manifest Store in a way that is not visually rendered, ensuring that Content Credentials persist with the content itself across platforms.

## **A.7.2. The C2PATextManifestWrapper Structure**

All unstructured text assets that wish to embed a Content Credential shall do so using Unicode variation selectors that adhere to the following syntax and semantics defined below.

**NOTE**

Unicode variation selectors (U+FE00-U+FE0F and U+E0100-U+E01EF) are used because they are specifically designed to be visually non-rendering while remaining part of the valid Unicode character set.

#### **A.7.2.1. Definition**

```
Container Type: C2PATextManifestWrapper (contains a C2PA Manifest Store in JUMBF format)
Encoding: Unicode Variation Selectors
Mandatory: No
Quantity: Zero or one
```

The C2PATextManifestWrapper embeds C2PA provenance into unstructured text. One such container contains a complete C2PA Manifest Store in JUMBF format.

#### **A.7.2.2. Syntax**

```
aligned(8) class C2PATextManifestWrapper {
  unsigned int(64) magic = 0x4332504154585400; // "C2PATXT\0"
  unsigned int(8) version = 1;
  unsigned int(32) manifestLength;
  unsigned int(8) jumbfContainer[manifestLength];
}
```

#### **A.7.2.3. Semantics**

#### **magic**

The identifier for C2PA text manifests, always C2PATXT\0 (0x4332504154585400).

#### **version**

Version of this text embedding specification (currently 1).

#### **manifestLength**

The length in bytes of the JUMBF container.

#### **jumbfContainer**

The raw bytes of the C2PA Manifest Store in JUMBF format.

## **A.7.3. Encoding and Decoding Algorithms**

### **A.7.3.1. Byte-to-Variation-Selector Conversion**

Each byte of the wrapped manifest shall be converted to a Unicode variation selector using the following algorithm:

```
function byteToVariationSelector(byte b) {
  if (b >= 0 && b <= 15) {
  return U+FE00 + b;
  } else if (b >= 16 && b <= 255) {
  return U+E0100 + (b - 16);
  }
}
```

#### **A.7.3.2. Variation-Selector-to-Byte Conversion**

To decode variation selectors back to bytes:

```
function variationSelectorToByte(codepoint vs) {
  if (vs >= U+FE00 && vs <= U+FE0F) {
  return vs - U+FE00;
  } else if (vs >= U+E0100 && vs <= U+E01EF) {
  return (vs - U+E0100) + 16;
  } else {
  return INVALID;
  }
}
```

### **A.7.4. Placement and Detection Strategy**

#### **A.7.4.1. Placement Rules**

The C2PATextManifestWrapper shall be embedded according to the following rules:

- 1. The wrapper shall be embedded as a single, contiguous block of variation selectors.
- 2. The wrapper shall be prefixed with a single Zero-Width No-Break Space (U+FEFF) character to ensure forward compatibility with future Unicode standards.
- 3. The wrapper should be placed at the end of the visible text content to simplify parsing and exclusion.
- 4. The wrapper shall not be split across multiple locations in the text.
- 5. Claim Generators should embed a single C2PATextManifestWrapper. Validators may encounter multiple wrappers; selection of the intended wrapper is governed by the exclusions field of the c2pa.hash.data assertion (see [Validating a text data hash\)](#page-119-0).
- 6. The wrapper shall follow the rules above to maximize compatibility with parsers and detection tools.

**NOTE**

This way, a parser can read and process the entire visible text content first, and once reaching the end of the content, it can look for the C2PATextManifestWrapper to handle provenance

#### <span id="page-271-0"></span>**A.7.4.2. Detection Algorithm**

A validator processing a text asset shall use the following method to identify the C2PATextManifestWrapper:

- 1. Scan the text from beginning to end for a Zero-Width No-Break Space (U+FEFF).
- 2. For each U+FEFF found, check that the subsequent contiguous sequence of Unicode Variation Selectors (U+FE00-U+FE0F, U+E0100-U+E01EF) is a potential wrapper.
- 3. For each potential wrapper:
  - a. Decode the first 8 variation selectors into bytes and check if they match the magic number C2PATXT\0 (0x4332504154585400).
  - b. If the magic number matches, proceed to decode and parse the rest of the C2PATextManifestWrapper structure to extract the C2PA Manifest Store.

## **A.7.5. Content Binding with Data Hash**

A c2pa.hash.data assertion provides a hard binding between the C2PA manifest and the text content. When used with unstructured text, the hashing follows specific normalization rules.

Refer to the Validation clause for the normative procedure to compute and verify the data hash for unstructured text: see [Validating a text data hash](#page-119-0).

### **A.7.6. Validation Requirements**

#### **A.7.6.1. Validating a data hash**

To validate a c2pa.hash.data assertion against unstructured text, a validator shall perform the standard checks for a data hash, with the following considerations:

- 1. The exclusions field in the assertion shall correspond to the location of the C2PATextManifestWrapper in the text.
- 2. The hash shall be computed on the NFC-normalized, UTF-8 encoded text after removing the bytes specified by the exclusions field, and it shall match the hash value in the assertion.

### **A.7.7. Validation Status Codes**

The following status codes are defined for text-based manifest validation:

#### **A.7.7.1. Failure Codes**

• manifest.text.corruptedWrapper: A C2PATextManifestWrapper magic number was detected, but the wrapper itself was malformed or incomplete.

• manifest.text.multipleWrappers: More than one valid C2PATextManifestWrapper was found in the text.

### **A.7.7.2. Normalization**

Both producers and consumers shall normalize text to Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC) before calculating hashes (see [UAX #15: Unicode Normalization Forms](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/)). This ensures consistent hash values across different platforms that may store text in different normalization forms.

#### **A.7.7.3. Exclusion Handling**

The exclusions field in the c2pa.hash.data assertion uses byte offsets in the NFC-normalized UTF-8 encoded text. Implementations shall be careful to:

- 1. Perform normalization before calculating offsets
- 2. Work with byte offsets, not character offsets
- 3. Validate that excluded regions correspond exactly to C2PATextManifestWrapper boundaries

# <span id="page-273-0"></span>**Appendix B: Implementation Details for c2pa.metadata**

The c2pa.metadata assertion shall only contain the subset of schemas and their fields as described below. However [custom metadata assertions](#page-222-1) may contain any values from these or other schemas.

**NOTE**

A machine readable list of all the valid schemas and their fields can be found on the [C2PA](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html) [Specification Website](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html).

The values present in a c2pa.metadata assertion may be unique to the metadata assertion or they may be taken from the standard "metadata blocks" of the asset format. In either case, they shall be serialized according to the rules of [JSON-LD serialization of XMP](https://www.iso.org/standard/79384.html) as described [here](#page-222-1).
